1
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:05,599
I'm really sorry.

2
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:07,639
Does he wear glasses or contact lenses?

3
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:10,319
Glasses.

4
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:30,039
You'll have to hurry up.

5
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:48,639
He decided that his brown leather
shoes were the best pair to wear.

6
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:52,439
His back hurt a little
but not like some other times in the past

7
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:54,399
when the pain was intolerable.

8
00:02:58,160 --> 00:03:01,159
He was thinking his wife
didn't love him at all any more.

9
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:06,839
He didn't burst into tears and he didn't think
that the first thing people most people do

10
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:10,159
when they realise someone
doesn't love them anymore is cry.

11
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:17,759
Sir, do you mind taking a look
into the camera here for me?

12
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:21,639
That'll do. Thank you.

13
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:28,559
Have you ever been on your own before?

14
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:30,639
No, never.

15
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:32,199
Are you allergic to any foods?

16
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:33,519
No.

17
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:35,959
Your last relationship
lasted how many years?

18
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,719
Around 12.

19
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:39,879
Do you remember how long exactly, sir?

20
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:41,839
11 years and one month.

21
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:45,319
- Sexual preference?
- Women.

22
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:51,159
However, I had one homosexual
experience in the past,

23
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:52,799
in college.

24
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:56,479
Is there a bisexual option available?

25
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:59,839
No, sir, this option is no longer available
since about last summer,

26
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:01,919
due to several operational problems.

27
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:05,039
I'm afraid you have to decide right now
if you want to be registered

28
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:06,999
as a homosexual or a heterosexual.

29
00:04:16,520 --> 00:04:19,199
I think I should be registered
as a heterosexual.

30
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:22,239
- Any children, sir?
- No.

31
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:23,639
And the dog?

32
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:26,519
My brother. He was here a couple of years
ago but he didn't make it.

33
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:28,439
You might remember him:

34
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:31,239
medium build, 48 years old,
bald patch, blond hair.

35
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:33,399
I'm afraid not, sir.

36
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:39,399
OK, I would like you to write your name
clearly on this form in capital letters.

37
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:41,359
And sign it, please.

38
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:48,439
That will do. Thank you very much.

39
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:53,479
OK, so you are not allowed to use
the volleyball or tennis courts.

40
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:55,439
These are only for the couples.

41
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:59,519
You can use facilities for individual
sports, such as squash and golf.

42
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:03,039
You can stay at the hotel for up to 45 days.
You'll be staying in a single room.

43
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:06,359
If everything goes well and you make it,
you'll be moved to a double room.

44
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:27,279
I'm afraid you cannot keep
any of your personal belongings.

45
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:29,479
We will provide everything you need.

46
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:32,959
As far as garments, accessories
and shoes are concerned.

47
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:35,759
- You can keep this.
- Thank you.

48
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:37,719
Shoe size, please?

49
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:39,479
Forty-four and a half.

50
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:42,159
Forty-four of forty-five?
There are no half sizes.

51
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:45,079
Forty-five.

52
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:02,999
If you need a haircut,
call reception one day ahead.

53
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:04,679
Smoking is not allowed.

54
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:08,319
That way you'll be able to run for longer
during the hunt without getting tired

55
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:10,519
and your breath won't smell when you kiss.

56
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:12,479
Enjoy your stay.

57
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:17,279
Excuse me, if we need to get a haircut,

58
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:19,919
we must call the reception the day before,
is that right?

59
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:21,639
- That's right.
- Great.

60
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:33,679
His room number was 101.

61
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:39,799
A tranquiliser gun was hanging
on the wall above his bed.

62
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:47,559
On the table were 20 tranquiliser darts,
a black plastic watch,

63
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:51,239
a pair of sunglasses and a cologne for men.

64
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:57,599
Inside the wardrobe
were four identical grey trousers,

65
00:06:57,920 --> 00:07:01,399
four identical button-down shirts
in white and blue,

66
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:05,159
a belt, socks, underwear, a blazer,

67
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:08,279
a striped tie and a white bathrobe.

68
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:17,079
He looked out the window.

69
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:22,159
The unconscious bodies of the captured
loners were lying on the wet ground.

70
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:26,679
"Thank God they wear those
waterproof ponchos," he thought.

71
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:30,279
Room 195.

72
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:33,159
Two loners, two extra days.

73
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:38,679
Room 272.

74
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:41,559
One loner, one extra day.

75
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:58,919
Hello. I'm the hotel manager
and this gentleman is my partner.

76
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:00,839
We'd like to welcome you.

77
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:02,119
You're one of the lucky ones.

78
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:05,279
You have one of our superior rooms,
which means you have a view.

79
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:07,439
- Did you read the leaflet?
- Yes, I did.

80
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:10,119
Very good. Now the fact
that you'll turn into an animal

81
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:12,959
if you fail to fall in love with someone
during your stay here

82
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,639
is not something that should upset you,
or get you down.

83
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:19,959
Just think as an animal you'll have
a second chance to find a companion.

84
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,919
But even then, you must be careful.

85
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:25,519
You need to choose a companion
that is a similar type of animal to you.

86
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:28,999
A wolf and a penguin
could never live together,

87
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:31,039
nor could a camel and a hippopotamus.

88
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:32,999
That would be absurd.

89
00:08:33,040 --> 00:08:34,599
Think about it.

90
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:38,799
I understand this discussion
is a little unpleasant for you.

91
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:41,359
But it is my duty to prepare you
psychologically,

92
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:43,039
for all possible outcomes.

93
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:46,359
Now, have you thought of what animal
you'd like to be if you end up alone?

94
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:49,479
- Yes, a lobster.
- Why a lobster?

95
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:52,439
Because lobsters live
for over 100 years,

96
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:56,599
are blue-blooded like aristocrats

97
00:08:58,360 --> 00:09:00,839
and stay fertile all their lives.

98
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:05,599
I also like the sea very much.

99
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:09,279
I water-ski and swim quite well,
since I was a teenager.

100
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:13,879
I must congratulate you. The first thing
most people think of is a dog,

101
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:15,919
which is why the world is full of dogs.

102
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:19,359
Very few people choose an unusual
animal, which is why they are endangered.

103
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:21,319
A lobster is an excellent choice.

104
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:23,279
Could you stand for us, please?

105
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:31,799
This is to show you how easy life is
when there are two of something

106
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:33,319
rather than just one.

107
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:35,119
We tend to forget that from time to time.

108
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:38,599
The handcuff will be removed
at the same time tomorrow.

109
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:41,599
- It's alright, Bob.
- I hope you enjoy your stay with us.

110
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:42,999
Goodbye.

111
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:55,079
Have a good day.

112
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:47,119
Good morning.

113
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:49,039
Room 101.

114
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:51,759
44 days left.

115
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:53,719
Breakfast is served.

116
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:02,319
Sit where you like.

117
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:19,799
His first day was one he'd never forget.

118
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:28,119
Near his table at breakfast sat
a young woman with her head tilted back.

119
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:31,399
Later on he would learn
that she often got nosebleeds.

120
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:34,399
Next to her sat her best friend.

121
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:40,959
He thanked the waiter
who served him his coffee,

122
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,119
and thought about his wife for a moment.

123
00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:47,199
A woman who seemed to like
butter biscuits

124
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:50,999
offered one to a man drinking
a Campari and soda for breakfast.

125
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:56,039
He then looked behind him
and saw a woman

126
00:11:56,920 --> 00:11:59,719
who he would later find out
was absolutely heartless.

127
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:04,919
And some others in the couples area,

128
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:07,639
whom he'd never meet
during his stay at the hotel.

129
00:12:11,560 --> 00:12:13,479
That morning, he was really hungry.

130
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:17,679
He could have eaten a whole chicken
but ate almost nothing.

131
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:20,799
- Hello.
- Hello.

132
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:24,159
I've decided to go for a walk outside
with my new friend.

133
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:26,199
Let me introduce you. This is Robert.

134
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:28,719
He stays in the room next to mine
and has a lisp.

135
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:31,919
Pleased to meet you.
I'm staying in room 101.

136
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:35,879
I'm on the same floor. I'm 186.

137
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:37,919
- Would you like to join us?
- Why not?

138
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:58,479
One of these days, it's gonna be me
on one of those yachts.

139
00:12:58,520 --> 00:13:00,439
What are those yachts?

140
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:03,759
It's the final ordeal before
letting you go and the hardest one.

141
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:07,119
15 days of vacation,
just a couple, alone.

142
00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:09,479
- Didn't you read the leaflet?
- I did.

143
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:14,279
Have you seen John's leg?

144
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:15,759
No.

145
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:17,959
John, would you show your leg?

146
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:23,519
Oh, yeah.

147
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:30,039
Room 187, day two.

148
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:36,399
Hello, everyone.

149
00:13:38,680 --> 00:13:41,559
My mother was left on her own
when my father fell in love with a woman

150
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:43,519
who was better at math than she was.

151
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:49,239
She had a postgraduate degree, I think,
whereas my mother was only a graduate.

152
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:52,119
I was 19 at the time.

153
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:58,359
My mother entered the hotel but didn't
make it and was turned into a wolf.

154
00:13:58,400 --> 00:14:00,319
I really missed her.

155
00:14:01,520 --> 00:14:03,439
I found out she'd been moved to a zoo.

156
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:05,399
I often went there to see her.

157
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:08,199
I'd give her raw meat.

158
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:09,999
I knew that wolves liked raw meat,

159
00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:12,679
but I couldn't figure out
which of the wolves was my mother,

160
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:15,079
so I used to give a little
bit to each of them.

161
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:19,919
One day,
I decided to enter the enclosure

162
00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:23,639
I really missed her and I wanted a hug.

163
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:26,759
I climbed the fence and jumped in.

164
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:30,279
All the wolves charged at once
and attacked me,

165
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:32,239
all but two, who stood motionless.

166
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:36,439
My guess is that one of those two
must have been my mother.

167
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:42,319
The zoo guards got to me quite quickly
and took me to the hospital.

168
00:14:43,160 --> 00:14:46,119
Thankfully, I didn't lose my leg,
I just have this limp,

169
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:48,479
which is also my defining characteristic.

170
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:51,319
My wife died six days ago.

171
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:55,159
She was very beautiful
and I loved her very much.

172
00:14:56,280 --> 00:14:58,199
She had a limp too.

173
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:04,119
Thank you, John.
You can return to your seat now.

174
00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:15,079
Let's move on to our next guest.

175
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:17,039
Room 104, day two.

176
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:26,359
Hello, everyone.

177
00:15:27,640 --> 00:15:29,679
This is only my second day here,

178
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:32,759
but already I feel like a member
of a wonderful group.

179
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:37,559
My defining characteristic
is that I have a very beautiful smile.

Yes.

188
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:17,279
What sort of dancing did you do?

189
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:21,319
Just depends on the music.

190
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:24,159
Do you need to sit down?

191
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:26,639

That woman you were talking to
has no feelings whatsoever.

She feels nothing at all.

203

She's the best hunter in the hotel,
silent and very fast.

204

216
00:18:26,360 --> 00:18:30,039
But don't worry, there are many ways to
remove bloodstains from clothing.

217
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:33,199
One way is to rinse the clothes
with cold water then rub with sea salt.

218
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:36,479
Another way is to scrub the stains
with cotton wool dipped in ammonia.

219
00:18:36,520 --> 00:18:39,599
The third way is to mix flour and water
into a paste, like toothpaste,

220
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:42,479
especially if the clothes are delicate
or brightly coloured.

And good luck with the hunt.

243
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:06,759
I wish I didn't have this limp.

244
00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:10,919
I used to be very good at running
but not any more.

245
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:13,159
I'm sure I'll be slower than them.

246
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:17,399
If I were you, I'd think of some tricks
that use the element of surprise

247
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:19,119
instead of speed.

248
00:20:20,120 --> 00:20:22,039
You're right.

249
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:23,719
That's what I'll do.

00:23:48,520 --> 00:23:50,439
Four loners, four extra days.

Room 101.

259
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:02,199

Please take off your trousers
and sit on the bed.

266
00:24:51,480 --> 00:24:53,679
Can we not do this today? It's awful.

267
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:57,439
I know. But I'm afraid we have to do it.

268
00:24:57,840 --> 00:25:00,479
And you have no idea how much
it helps you psychologically

269
00:25:00,520 --> 00:25:02,199
in your search for a partner.

270
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:04,239
Man eats with woman.

271
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:29,039
Lie down.

272
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:33,319
Spread your legs. More.

273
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:49,319
- Is your room number 186?
- Yes, it is.

274
00:25:52,440 --> 00:25:54,799
I imagine you know that
masturbation is not permitted

275
00:25:54,840 --> 00:25:57,159
in the rooms
or any other area of the hotel.

276
00:25:57,200 --> 00:25:58,599
Yes.

277
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:02,359
And yet it has brought to my attention
that you continue to do it.

278
00:26:14,200 --> 00:26:17,799
Today you became erect quicker
than on other days. That's good.

279
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:19,759
Please, just a little longer.

280
00:26:19,800 --> 00:26:21,719
Have a good day.

281
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:23,959
That's awful. Just awful.

282
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,639
Were you looking at a photograph
while you were masturbating?

283
00:26:26,680 --> 00:26:27,799
Yes.

284
00:26:28,360 --> 00:26:30,279
What did the photograph show?

285
00:26:33,080 --> 00:26:35,599
A naked woman on a horse in the country.

286
00:26:36,680 --> 00:26:40,119
If I were in your shoes, I would not be
ogling the naked woman but the horse.

287
00:26:40,160 --> 00:26:43,959
I'm sure that the horse was once
a weak and cowardly man just like you.

288
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:45,919
Woman walks alone.

289
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:56,399
Help.

290
00:26:57,800 --> 00:26:58,839
Help.

291
00:27:00,440 --> 00:27:01,879
Help.

292
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:03,839
This is not necessary. Please.

293
00:27:05,240 --> 00:27:07,879
- It was an accident. I got carried away.
- Please.

294
00:27:07,920 --> 00:27:10,679
- This is not necessary.
- Please place your hand in the toaster.

295
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:12,119
This could be a warning.

296
00:27:13,160 --> 00:27:15,359
Look, I've been good otherwise, I

297
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:27,759
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Please.

298
00:27:28,680 --> 00:27:31,479
Please, please, that's hurting.

299
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:33,439
Woman walks with man.

300
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:03,479
What they do,
as soon as you enter the room,

301
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:06,119
is to wash your body
and your head really well.

302
00:28:06,160 --> 00:28:07,999
How do you know?

303
00:28:08,040 --> 00:28:10,399
My uncle used to know a waiter
who worked there.

304
00:28:10,440 --> 00:28:12,439
No waiters know about the procedure,

305
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:14,519
they're not allowed inside that room.

306
00:28:14,560 --> 00:28:16,879
Nevertheless, they peel off the skin,

307
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:20,159
which has become soft
due to the water and the soap.

308
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:25,839
Afterwards, they remove the heart,
the eyes and other vital organs of the body

309
00:28:25,880 --> 00:28:27,639
with a laser or scalpels.

310
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:32,679
Then the procedure changes
according to the animal one has chosen.

311
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:34,639
That makes total sense.

312
00:28:34,680 --> 00:28:38,039
I mean, I suppose
mammals demand a different kind of work

313
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:40,759
than fowls, for example.

314
00:28:40,800 --> 00:28:42,199
Exactly.

315
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:44,399
Afterwards they throw
the remaining body parts

316
00:28:44,440 --> 00:28:46,599
into the casks outside
the hotel's restaurant

317
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:49,599
and distribute the blood
to the hospitals in the city.

318
00:28:49,640 --> 00:28:51,159
Why is that?

319
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:54,919
The blood is used for surgeries
where there are no blood donors available.

320
00:28:59,720 --> 00:29:02,079
- New guests arrived yesterday.
- Yes, I saw.

321
00:29:02,120 --> 00:29:03,799
I think I saw a woman with a limp.

322
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:05,759
It's just a sprained ankle.

323
00:29:06,800 --> 00:29:08,919
She'll be walking normally again
in a few days.

324
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:10,919
That's a shame.

325
00:29:11,960 --> 00:29:14,239
That is a shame indeed.

326
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:22,599
One night on the coach, he sat next to
the woman who liked butter biscuits.

327
00:29:23,320 --> 00:29:27,079
He gazed out of the window,
not looking at anything in particular,

328
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:29,039
just trying to avoid talking to her.

329
00:29:30,160 --> 00:29:32,439
- How's Bob?
- He's fine.

330
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:36,559
I'd give anything to go for a walk
with you and Bob one afternoon.

331
00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:40,039
The dog's not allowed out of the room,
I'm afraid.

332
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:43,519
"There are some excuses
that no one can argue with," he thought.

333
00:29:43,560 --> 00:29:46,959
Some excuses are without doubt
better than others.

334
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:48,919
And that was a really good one.

335
00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:53,999
These biscuits are for Bob.

336
00:29:54,040 --> 00:29:55,240
I want you to give them to him

337
00:29:55,280 --> 00:29:57,319
whenever you want to reward him
for something.

338
00:29:57,360 --> 00:29:59,479
- Tell him they're from me.
- Thank you.

339
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:01,839
Can I come to your room sometime
for a chat?

340
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:05,919
I could give you a blow-job
or you could just fuck me.

341
00:30:06,440 --> 00:30:10,079
I always swallow after fellatio and I've
got absolutely no problem with anal sex

342
00:30:10,120 --> 00:30:11,439
if that's your thing.

343
00:30:11,480 --> 00:30:14,879
My ex-husband always used to say I had
the most beautiful thighs he'd ever seen.

344
00:30:14,920 --> 00:30:16,639
But let's not talk about him.

345
00:30:16,680 --> 00:30:19,679
My room number is 180,
so my telephone extension's 180.

346
00:30:21,280 --> 00:30:23,199
Hope I can catch some loners tonight.

347
00:30:23,240 --> 00:30:25,399
I haven't caught any the last few nights.

348
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:28,119
Hope you catch lots too.

349
00:30:28,160 --> 00:30:30,079
Thank you very much.

350
00:30:33,160 --> 00:30:35,079
If I don't find a suitable partner soon,

351
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:38,559
I'm gonna kill myself
by throwing myself out of one of the rooms.

352
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:41,679
Out of the window.

353
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:44,399
I want you to know that.

354
00:30:44,440 --> 00:30:46,359
My room is on the first floor.

355
00:30:46,400 --> 00:30:49,439
"I hope I catch some loners today,"
she said.

356
00:30:50,120 --> 00:30:52,519
"And I hope you catch lots too."

357
00:30:52,560 --> 00:30:56,079
She then told him that if she didn't find
a suitable partner soon,

358
00:30:56,120 --> 00:30:59,959
she was going to kill herself
by jumping from one of the room windows,

359
00:31:01,040 --> 00:31:04,279
320, maybe, or one higher up.

360
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:07,319
480, that would be even better.

361
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:13,519
When she stopped talking, he stared at her
blankly, not knowing what to say.

362
00:31:14,840 --> 00:31:16,639
He then looked out at the woods

363
00:31:16,680 --> 00:31:19,239
and thought once more
how good his excuse had been.

364
00:31:22,280 --> 00:31:24,199
Not bad. Bit higher.

365
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:31,159
Have you thought about what animals
you wanna be if you don't make it?

366
00:31:31,880 --> 00:31:33,399
A lobster.

367
00:31:41,280 --> 00:31:43,319
I'm gonna be a parrot if I don't make it.

368
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:49,319
Why don't you become parrots too?

369
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:50,879
And then we'll all be together.

370
00:31:50,920 --> 00:31:52,719
You're a complete idiot,

371
00:31:52,760 --> 00:31:54,519
picking one of the few animals
that can talk

372
00:31:54,560 --> 00:31:55,999
when you have a speech impediment.

373
00:31:56,040 --> 00:31:57,599
You'll lisp, even as an animal.

374
00:31:57,640 --> 00:32:01,559
As for you, they'll catch you and put you
in a pot of boiling water until you die.

375
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:04,439
And then they'll crack open your claws
with a tool, like pliers,

376
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:06,599
and they'll suck out what little
flesh you have with their mouths.

377
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:08,559
You're pathetic, both of you.

378
00:32:10,120 --> 00:32:11,999
I'm not gonna be turned into some animal.

379
00:32:12,040 --> 00:32:14,719
I'll come and visit you, though,
with my partner,

380
00:32:14,760 --> 00:32:18,679
when we're walking together in some park
or when we're swimming in the sea.

381
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:20,639
Or when we're on one of our trips.

382
00:32:27,640 --> 00:32:29,079
Friends.

383
00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:30,959
I'm not afraid.

384
00:32:35,320 --> 00:32:37,239
Room 187, please.

385
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:44,599
It's no coincidence that the targets are
shaped like single people and not couples.

386
00:33:26,440 --> 00:33:27,559
Hello.

387
00:33:29,040 --> 00:33:31,079
- Hello.
- Your swimsuit is very nice.

388
00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:32,559
Thank,

389
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:36,559
- Thank you very much.
- You're welcome.

390
00:33:37,840 --> 00:33:41,719
Do you like to swim breaststroke,
front crawl, butterfly or backstroke?

391
00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:43,279
I like all strokes equally.

392
00:33:43,320 --> 00:33:45,239
You know, I love breaststroke.

393
00:33:45,280 --> 00:33:47,359
No, really.
My friends often tease me and say,

394
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:49,399
"Stop swimming breaststroke all the time."

395
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:51,359
And then they laugh.

396
00:33:51,400 --> 00:33:54,799
Breaststroke is great.
It's excellent exercise for the back.

397
00:34:22,640 --> 00:34:26,039
When swimming breaststroke,
men shouldn't wear swim shorts,

398
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:29,679
as it really limits movement
in the buttocks.

399
00:34:29,720 --> 00:34:32,919
- But you knew that, didn't you?
- I think your nose is bleeding.

400
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:34,479
Really?

401
00:34:36,520 --> 00:34:38,199
Ah, no.

402
00:34:39,400 --> 00:34:41,319
This happens to me all the time.

403
00:34:43,080 --> 00:34:44,999
It's really, really annoying.

404
00:34:45,480 --> 00:34:47,799
I know. I have a nosebleed problem too.

405
00:35:00,840 --> 00:35:03,359
I saw what you did. It must have hurt.

406
00:35:11,880 --> 00:35:13,799
Is it coming out?

407
00:35:15,160 --> 00:35:16,519
No.

408
00:35:19,560 --> 00:35:21,399
- Yes.
- Can I use a tissue?

409
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:22,879
Yes.

410
00:35:25,600 --> 00:35:29,039
I'm gonna ask you a question
and I want you to answer me honestly.

411
00:35:29,600 --> 00:35:32,759
What's worse:
to die of cold and hunger in the woods,

412
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:36,119
to become an animal that will be killed
and eaten by some bigger animal

413
00:35:36,160 --> 00:35:37,999
or to have a nosebleed
from time to time?

414
00:35:39,840 --> 00:35:43,279
To become an animal that will be killed
and eaten by some bigger animal.

415
00:35:43,320 --> 00:35:45,239
- Exactly.
- Mm.

416
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:47,759
- She doesn't suspect that you're lying?
- No.

417
00:35:55,360 --> 00:35:57,719
I'm very happy
because we have a new couple.

418
00:35:58,400 --> 00:36:02,559
They met just two days ago but they're
very much in love and perfectly suited.

419
00:36:02,600 --> 00:36:06,759
They both have the same problem with
their noses, they bleed quite suddenly.

420
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:13,359
Tomorrow they'll be transferred
to a double room

421
00:36:13,400 --> 00:36:15,759
with a larger wardrobe
and a larger bathroom.

422
00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:18,119
They will remain in the double room
for two weeks,

423
00:36:18,160 --> 00:36:21,479
and then they'll be transferred to
the yachts for a further two weeks.

424
00:36:21,520 --> 00:36:24,999
We wish you every success and we hope
you will return to the city as a couple.

425
00:36:28,840 --> 00:36:30,999
- I'm very happy.
- Me, too.

426
00:36:31,040 --> 00:36:32,519
Congratulations.

427
00:36:32,560 --> 00:36:35,719
The course of your relationship
will be monitored closely

428
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:37,639
by our staff and by me personally.

429
00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:40,799
If you encounter any problems,
any tensions, any arguing,

430
00:36:40,840 --> 00:36:44,119
that you cannot resolve yourselves,
you will be assigned children.

431
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:46,079
That usually helps, a lot.

432
00:36:59,240 --> 00:37:02,319
Good morning, room 101.

433
00:37:03,160 --> 00:37:05,079
Seven days left.

434
00:37:05,120 --> 00:37:07,039
Breakfast is served.

435
00:37:46,760 --> 00:37:48,959
You have really nice hair.

436
00:37:49,680 --> 00:37:51,199
I know.

437
00:37:51,240 --> 00:37:52,799
Look.

438
00:37:59,560 --> 00:38:01,359
How do you like mine?

439
00:38:02,360 --> 00:38:04,999
Well, I think you have quite dry hair.

440
00:38:05,800 --> 00:38:07,719
The colour is OK, though.

441
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:10,439
The most important thing
is that you're not bald.

442
00:38:11,360 --> 00:38:15,719
However, when it comes to men, baldness
is always a possibility you can't avoid.

443
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:18,399
- Is your father bald?
- No, he isn't.

444
00:38:19,240 --> 00:38:23,279
And even if someday I lose my hair,
there are things I can do to get my hair back.

445
00:38:23,320 --> 00:38:24,919
I can have a hair transplant.

446
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:27,719
- You can always tell when someone's had a hair transplant.
- I know.

447
00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:31,679
Nice hair is not something you can get.
It's something you're born with.

448
00:38:31,720 --> 00:38:34,919
And the fact that your father isn't bald
shouldn't put you at ease.

449
00:38:37,560 --> 00:38:40,399
Have you decided what
you're going to do on your last day?

450
00:38:43,520 --> 00:38:45,439
I'm still thinking about it.

451
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:51,119
Morning, ladies.

452
00:38:56,680 --> 00:38:59,999
So today is your last day.

453
00:39:00,040 --> 00:39:03,999
And as is customary, you can choose how
you would like to spend your last night.

454
00:39:04,040 --> 00:39:05,919
What I always say in these situations is,

455
00:39:05,960 --> 00:39:08,919
it would be wise to choose
something you can't do as an animal...

456
00:39:08,960 --> 00:39:11,119
for example,
read a work of classic literature

457
00:39:12,040 --> 00:39:14,079
or sing a song you really like.

458
00:39:14,120 --> 00:39:16,039
It would be silly to choose

459
00:39:16,080 --> 00:39:18,559
for example a walk in the grounds,

460
00:39:18,600 --> 00:39:20,839
or to have sexual intercourse
with another person,

461
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:23,399
because those are things
you can do as an animal.

462
00:39:24,720 --> 00:39:28,359
But first your best friend has written
something she'd like to read to you,

463
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:30,319
which is really very touching.

464
00:39:33,120 --> 00:39:35,039
"We always sat together at school.

465
00:39:35,080 --> 00:39:37,279
And whenever I had a problem,
I talked to you about it

466
00:39:37,320 --> 00:39:39,479
because you always gave the best advice.

467
00:39:40,160 --> 00:39:43,079
When we didn't manage to find
dance partners at the school prom,

468
00:39:43,120 --> 00:39:47,079
the fact that we were together at that
difficult moment gave me strength.

469
00:39:47,120 --> 00:39:49,239
I'm sorry that things have come to this.

470
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:54,039
I'm sure that if you had a few more days,
you would find someone, just like I did,

471
00:39:54,080 --> 00:39:55,959
because you're an admirable person,

472
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:58,559
and you have very beautiful hair
and very nice breasts.

473
00:39:59,200 --> 00:40:01,839
I was always jealous of your hair,
you know that.

474
00:40:01,880 --> 00:40:06,199
You were, are, and always will be
my best friend and I'll think of you often.

475
00:40:06,840 --> 00:40:10,679
And I'll always wear those silver earrings
you gave me for my birthday.

476
00:40:10,720 --> 00:40:12,279
I'll miss you.

477
00:40:12,320 --> 00:40:17,079
And however many new girlfriends I make in
a few days when I move back into the city,

478
00:40:17,120 --> 00:40:19,279
I don't think I'll find another as true."

479
00:40:22,440 --> 00:40:24,439
I'd like to watch the film Stand By Me,

480
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:28,239
with River Phoenix, Kiefer Sutherland
and Richard Dreyfus. Alone.

481
00:40:28,280 --> 00:40:30,199
Excellent choice.

482
00:40:30,240 --> 00:40:32,159
Lovely film.

483
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:51,399
Please leave a message.

484
00:40:53,720 --> 00:40:56,359
Hello.
You're probably in the bathroom,

485
00:40:56,400 --> 00:40:58,679
that's why you can't hear the phone ring.

486
00:40:58,720 --> 00:41:00,839
Nothing like a cold shower in the morning.

487
00:41:01,560 --> 00:41:06,159
Well, I'll call you a little bit later,
after you've finished your shower.

488
00:41:06,840 --> 00:41:08,119
We'll talk later.

489
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:10,479
Bye.

490
00:41:17,680 --> 00:41:19,719
One day, as he was playing golf,

491
00:41:19,760 --> 00:41:22,039
he thought that it is
more difficult to pretend

492
00:41:22,080 --> 00:41:24,279
that you do have feelings when you don't

493
00:41:24,320 --> 00:41:26,959
than to pretend you don't have feelings
when you do.

494
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:31,439
He also thought that he liked her accent,

495
00:41:32,280 --> 00:41:34,879
and he'd always preferred women
with short hair.

496
00:41:35,440 --> 00:41:37,359
So he decided that she was the one.

497
00:41:38,440 --> 00:41:41,199
During the hunt, he would follow her,

498
00:41:41,240 --> 00:41:43,919
and as soon as she shot a loner,
he would say to her,

499
00:41:44,560 --> 00:41:48,599
"I wish we had real guns
instead of these silly tranquiliser ones.

500
00:41:48,640 --> 00:41:51,159
Why don't you kill him
with your bare hands?"

501
00:41:51,720 --> 00:41:55,719
And the moment she puts her hands
around the loner's throat, he would say,

502
00:41:56,400 --> 00:41:58,319
"I hope he dies right away."

503
00:42:31,280 --> 00:42:33,199
Did anyone see what happened?

504
00:42:45,120 --> 00:42:46,839
What happened?

505
00:42:46,880 --> 00:42:48,919
She jumped from the window of room 180.

506
00:42:50,240 --> 00:42:52,399
There's blood and biscuits everywhere.

507
00:42:52,440 --> 00:42:54,359
I hope she dies right away.

508
00:42:55,280 --> 00:42:57,199
On second thoughts

509
00:42:57,240 --> 00:42:59,719
I hope she suffers quite a bit
before she dies.

510
00:42:59,760 --> 00:43:03,039
I just hope her pathetic screams
can't be heard from my room.

511
00:43:03,080 --> 00:43:07,039
Because I was thinking about having
a lie-down and I need peace and quiet.

512
00:43:07,680 --> 00:43:09,719
I was playing golf and I'm quite tired.

513
00:43:09,760 --> 00:43:12,879
The last thing I need is some woman
dying slowly and loudly.

514
00:43:12,920 --> 00:43:14,919
I can't hear you with all this screaming.

515
00:43:14,960 --> 00:43:17,439
We'll talk some other time
when it's quieter.

516
00:43:20,320 --> 00:43:21,839
Goodbye.

517
00:43:25,320 --> 00:43:27,239
Goodbye.

518
00:43:33,840 --> 00:43:35,799
One message.

519
00:43:35,840 --> 00:43:38,559
Hello.
You're probably in the bathroom,

520
00:43:38,600 --> 00:43:40,759
that's why you can't hear the phone ring.

521
00:43:40,800 --> 00:43:42,679
Nothing like a cold shower in the morning.

522
00:43:43,680 --> 00:43:48,279
Well, I'll call you a little bit later,
after you've finished your shower.

523
00:43:49,240 --> 00:43:51,039
We'll talk later.

524
00:43:51,680 --> 00:43:53,039
Bye.

525
00:43:55,880 --> 00:43:57,799
Mind if I join you?

526
00:44:06,240 --> 00:44:08,159
Martini?

527
00:45:02,200 --> 00:45:03,719
I think we are a match.

528
00:45:03,760 --> 00:45:05,679
Yes, I think so too.

529
00:45:08,520 --> 00:45:11,319
The keys to the double room, please.

530
00:45:18,840 --> 00:45:21,959
I wish you the best of luck.
We all wish you the best of luck.

531
00:45:36,720 --> 00:45:39,839
Do you normally sleep
on the left side of the bed or the right?

532
00:45:39,880 --> 00:45:41,799
- The right. You?
- The left.

533
00:45:42,600 --> 00:45:44,359
Perfect.

534
00:46:04,960 --> 00:46:06,879
Spread your legs.

535
00:46:21,240 --> 00:46:24,039
Should I turn off the light
or would you like to read?

536
00:46:24,080 --> 00:46:26,439
I'd like to read.
Does the light bother you?

537
00:46:26,480 --> 00:46:27,759
No.

538
00:46:27,800 --> 00:46:29,719
I'm not bothered by light or noise.

539
00:46:29,760 --> 00:46:31,679
I'm a deep sleeper.

540
00:46:47,720 --> 00:46:49,479
- Hello.
- Hello.

541
00:46:49,520 --> 00:46:50,839
Congratulations.

542
00:46:50,880 --> 00:46:53,279
- Thank you.
- This is our new daughter.

543
00:46:53,320 --> 00:46:54,959
Her name's Elizabeth.

544
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:58,119
Elizabeth, give the nice man a kiss.
He's a friend of mine.

545
00:46:58,920 --> 00:47:02,359
The last thing I want right now
is a kiss from a silly little girl.

546
00:47:06,200 --> 00:47:07,519
Come on, move away.

547
00:47:07,560 --> 00:47:09,399
Don't cry, Elizabeth, you should thank me.

548
00:47:09,440 --> 00:47:11,999
Now you'll have a limp
and be more like your father.

549
00:47:17,920 --> 00:47:19,839
What was that sound?

550
00:47:19,880 --> 00:47:21,599
Did you say something?

551
00:47:21,640 --> 00:47:23,559
No.

552
00:47:24,480 --> 00:47:27,439
Do you mind if we fuck in a position
where I can see your face?

553
00:47:27,480 --> 00:47:28,639
Sure.

554
00:47:35,520 --> 00:47:38,199
Turn the light on please,
so I can see you better.

555
00:48:30,240 --> 00:48:32,159
Good morning.

556
00:48:36,440 --> 00:48:37,839
Morning.

557
00:48:38,920 --> 00:48:40,839
I killed your brother.

558
00:48:41,520 --> 00:48:43,439
I left him to die very slowly.

559
00:48:43,480 --> 00:48:45,479
He may not be dead yet even as we speak.

560
00:48:46,440 --> 00:48:48,039
I was kicking him for ages.

561
00:48:49,480 --> 00:48:51,039
Doesn't matter.

562
00:48:52,200 --> 00:48:54,519
He whined a little,
a strange kind of bark.

563
00:48:55,160 --> 00:48:56,759
Something like this.

564
00:49:03,480 --> 00:49:05,399
It must have been from the pain.

565
00:49:05,440 --> 00:49:07,359
- You didn't hear anything?
- No.

566
00:49:08,120 --> 00:49:10,039
You really are a deep sleeper.

567
00:49:10,880 --> 00:49:13,319
- Would you like some coffee?
- I'd love some.

568
00:49:14,600 --> 00:49:17,359
As soon as I wash my face
and brush my teeth, though.

569
00:49:20,720 --> 00:49:24,159
I can't wait to hear the story
you promised to tell me last night,

570
00:49:24,960 --> 00:49:27,439
about that student of
yours at the university

571
00:49:27,480 --> 00:49:29,399
and his awful final project.

572
00:49:46,960 --> 00:49:48,879
It's really a very funny story.

573
00:49:49,960 --> 00:49:51,879
His name was Ryess -

574
00:49:51,920 --> 00:49:54,559
R-Y-E-S-S. Ryess.

575
00:50:00,640 --> 00:50:03,839
These aren't tears, it's just water.
I just washed my face.

576
00:50:04,600 --> 00:50:07,599
I knew you were lying.
I can't understand why you did it,

577
00:50:07,640 --> 00:50:11,679
when you know as well as anyone that a
relationship cannot be built on a lie.

578
00:50:11,720 --> 00:50:16,039
We're going to the hotel manager right now
and you'll get the punishment you deserve.

579
00:50:16,080 --> 00:50:17,719
What's the punishment for this?

580
00:50:17,760 --> 00:50:20,239
They turn you into the animal
no one wants to be.

581
00:51:59,680 --> 00:52:01,839
I saw your partner running back that way.

582
00:52:01,880 --> 00:52:03,799
He looked frantic.

583
00:52:03,840 --> 00:52:05,759
Is everything OK?

584
00:52:29,160 --> 00:52:32,919
At first he wanted to kill her
in some horrible and painful way,

585
00:52:32,960 --> 00:52:35,599
like the death she had inflicted
on his brother.

586
00:52:35,640 --> 00:52:37,559
Take her legs, please.

587
00:52:38,160 --> 00:52:41,599
He thought about kicking her
in the stomach over and over again,

588
00:52:41,640 --> 00:52:45,039
and then stabbing her
in the same spot in the stomach.

589
00:52:50,640 --> 00:52:53,319
But then he thought
there wouldn't be much point,

590
00:52:53,360 --> 00:52:55,879
because she was already unconscious

591
00:52:55,920 --> 00:52:58,919
and wouldn't feel any pain
from the kicks, or the knife.

592
00:53:01,120 --> 00:53:04,079
You have to shoot me
so they won't suspect I helped you.

593
00:53:04,120 --> 00:53:06,039
A hotel maid helped him.

594
00:53:06,080 --> 00:53:09,279
He couldn't understand why she did it.

595
00:53:22,320 --> 00:53:24,439
So he decided to turn her into an animal.

596
00:53:26,040 --> 00:53:29,559
He dragged her to the room
where the transformations took place.

597
00:53:30,840 --> 00:53:34,119
I asked him many times
what sort of animal he turned her into,

598
00:53:34,160 --> 00:53:36,159
but he always gave me the same answer:

599
00:53:36,200 --> 00:53:38,119
"That's none of your concern."

600
00:53:46,760 --> 00:53:49,919
That night,
he left the hotel once and for all.

601
00:53:53,560 --> 00:53:56,359
He began to run without knowing
where he was headed.

602
00:53:57,320 --> 00:53:59,239
But he was headed towards us.

603
00:54:25,160 --> 00:54:27,079
This was the start of his new life.

604
00:54:28,600 --> 00:54:31,879
And back then, he didn't know
how much it hurts to be alone,

605
00:54:34,840 --> 00:54:39,319
how much it hurts when you cannot reach
to rub pain-relief ointment on your back,

606
00:54:39,360 --> 00:54:41,279
and you are constantly in pain.

607
00:55:25,440 --> 00:55:26,999
I found him in the woods.

608
00:55:27,040 --> 00:55:28,959
He escaped from the hotel.

609
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:30,919
Are you a doctor, by any chance?

610
00:55:31,480 --> 00:55:33,959
- No.
- That's a pity.

611
00:55:34,600 --> 00:55:36,519
We need a doctor around.

612
00:55:36,560 --> 00:55:39,319
We had one, but they caught him
a couple of months ago.

613
00:55:39,360 --> 00:55:41,279
I'm an architect.

614
00:55:42,160 --> 00:55:43,719
That's OK.

615
00:55:43,760 --> 00:55:45,159
So, welcome.

616
00:55:45,200 --> 00:55:47,519
You can stay with us
for as long as you like.

617
00:55:48,240 --> 00:55:51,159
You can be a loner until the day you die.
There is no time limit.

618
00:55:51,200 --> 00:55:53,119
Thank you very much.

619
00:56:06,800 --> 00:56:08,039
By the way,

620
00:56:08,080 --> 00:56:11,799
any romantic or sexual relations
between loners are not permitted.

621
00:56:12,120 --> 00:56:14,119
And any such acts are punished.

622
00:56:14,160 --> 00:56:16,079
Is that clear?

623
00:56:17,320 --> 00:56:19,439
Can I have a conversation with someone?

624
00:56:19,480 --> 00:56:21,399
Of course you can.

625
00:56:21,440 --> 00:56:24,319
So as long as there is no flirting
or anything like that.

626
00:56:24,880 --> 00:56:26,879
That applies to dance nights as well.

627
00:56:27,720 --> 00:56:31,439
We all dance by ourselves,
that's why we only play electronic music.

628
00:56:42,560 --> 00:56:44,479
What happened to your mouth?

629
00:56:45,800 --> 00:56:48,279
He can't speak.
He was given the Red Kiss.

630
00:56:49,560 --> 00:56:51,279
What's the Red Kiss?

631
00:56:51,320 --> 00:56:54,639
We slashed his lips with a razor
and the lips of another loner,

632
00:56:54,680 --> 00:56:56,639
and we forced them to kiss each other.

633
00:56:56,680 --> 00:56:58,599
That was a couple of days ago now.

634
00:56:59,480 --> 00:57:03,319
But the cuts were deep and they're still in pain.
They were flirting, you know.

635
00:57:13,040 --> 00:57:15,919
Some punishments
are worse than other punishments.

636
00:57:17,960 --> 00:57:21,119
Having your thumb cut is worse
than having your head shaved.

637
00:57:21,880 --> 00:57:24,319
And having a hot boiled egg
under your armpit

638
00:57:24,360 --> 00:57:26,359
is worse than having your leg kicked.

639
00:57:27,920 --> 00:57:31,759
The punishment I am afraid of
isn't the Red Kiss but another one,

640
00:57:31,800 --> 00:57:33,559
that is called the Red Intercourse.

641
00:57:34,800 --> 00:57:38,879
I have never seen it happen,
but it's not difficult to imagine what it means.

642
00:57:39,920 --> 00:57:42,279
Oh, my God, I am so afraid of it.

643
00:57:51,800 --> 00:57:53,519
Move.

644
00:57:54,800 --> 00:57:56,239
Hide.

645
00:57:59,200 --> 00:58:00,599
Move.

646
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:03,039
Hide.

647
00:58:08,800 --> 00:58:10,599
That was the first time I saw him.

648
00:58:11,560 --> 00:58:13,719
He was hiding behind a tree close to mine.

649
00:58:14,960 --> 00:58:16,879
He seemed quite presentable.

650
00:58:17,680 --> 00:58:19,599
The next day, in the city,

651
00:58:19,960 --> 00:58:22,359
he found out that I was short-sighted too.

652
00:58:28,640 --> 00:58:30,359
That night in my sleep,

653
00:58:30,400 --> 00:58:33,519
I dreamt that we lived in a big house
together in the city,

654
00:58:33,560 --> 00:58:35,639
with a large well-lit kitchen,

655
00:58:35,680 --> 00:58:39,679
and I was wearing dark blue trousers
and a tight cream blouse.

656
00:58:39,720 --> 00:58:42,999
And he took my clothes off
and fucked me up the arse.

657
00:58:49,720 --> 00:58:52,599
And as he was fucking me,
a thug came into the kitchen,

658
00:58:52,640 --> 00:58:56,239
and took the steak knives
from the second draw and attacked us,

659
00:58:56,280 --> 00:58:59,319
stabbing the knives into our bellies
one by one.

660
00:58:59,920 --> 00:59:01,679
I woke up terrified.

661
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:13,719
Try harder.

662
00:59:14,760 --> 00:59:17,879
Don't give up. You know you should
have been more careful.

663
00:59:18,720 --> 00:59:22,759
Try harder or they'll find you and you'll
be turned into an animal - a weak one.

664
00:59:25,080 --> 00:59:28,199
We must get a move on now.
It's really too dangerous to stay here.

665
00:59:28,240 --> 00:59:31,439
If you manage to free yourself,
run as fast as you can and come find us.

666
00:59:31,480 --> 00:59:34,319
If you manage to free yourself
but think you'll die from the bleeding,

667
00:59:34,360 --> 00:59:35,559
go straight to your grave.

668
00:59:35,600 --> 00:59:37,959
Have you dug your own grave?

669
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:39,319
Yes.

670
00:59:39,360 --> 00:59:41,279
Very good.

671
00:59:41,320 --> 00:59:43,239
That's enough for now.

672
00:59:51,320 --> 00:59:53,319
I'm going to go hunting for truffles.

673
00:59:53,360 --> 00:59:56,839
They're delicious and quite rare.
A kilo can fetch a lot of money.

674
00:59:56,880 --> 00:59:59,959
You're going to need a pig.
They're impossible to find otherwise.

675
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:01,279
- I know.
- Don't be long.

676
01:00:01,320 --> 01:00:03,399
- Gotta get them back in 50 minutes.
- OK.

677
01:00:28,640 --> 01:00:30,199
Hello, David.

678
01:00:30,240 --> 01:00:32,159
Hello, Robert.

679
01:00:34,240 --> 01:00:36,359
What you did to that woman was dreadful.

680
01:00:36,400 --> 01:00:38,039
She killed my brother.

681
01:00:38,080 --> 01:00:40,479
I would have done the same thing
if she'd killed you.

682
01:00:40,520 --> 01:00:43,679
You're like a brother to me. Oh,
you're my best friend in the whole world.

683
01:00:44,400 --> 01:00:47,079
I don't think I'm your best friend
in the whole world.

684
01:00:47,120 --> 01:00:49,119
You used to spend much more time
with John.

685
01:00:49,160 --> 01:00:51,079
Oh, who's John?

686
01:00:51,120 --> 01:00:53,039
- John, the Limping Man.
- Oh, yeah.

687
01:00:53,080 --> 01:00:54,999
I didn't even remember his name.

688
01:00:55,040 --> 01:00:56,959
Or his face.

689
01:00:57,000 --> 01:00:59,679
You're the one I think of
whenever I need a friend.

690
01:01:00,960 --> 01:01:02,879
Nevertheless, did John make it?

691
01:01:05,480 --> 01:01:07,479
They're getting ready for the yacht.

692
01:01:07,520 --> 01:01:08,999
It all begins this week.

693
01:01:09,040 --> 01:01:11,839
Everyone says they're gonna make it
as they're perfectly suited

694
01:01:11,880 --> 01:01:14,599
and the child will help them get past
the fighting and arguing.

695
01:01:14,640 --> 01:01:17,719
- That's great.
- You're not thinking about coming back?

696
01:01:17,760 --> 01:01:20,279
You know, if you told the hotel manager
about your brother,

697
01:01:20,320 --> 01:01:21,599
she'd probably forgive you.

698
01:01:21,640 --> 01:01:23,639
No, it's really nice to be on your own.

699
01:01:24,320 --> 01:01:26,239
There's no one tying you down.

700
01:01:26,280 --> 01:01:29,839
You listen to music whenever you like,
you masturbate whenever you want,

701
01:01:29,880 --> 01:01:31,799
go for walks whenever you like,

702
01:01:31,840 --> 01:01:33,759
have a chat whenever you like.

703
01:01:33,800 --> 01:01:35,639
I don't miss companionship at all.

704
01:01:36,280 --> 01:01:38,639
I just miss you,
'cause you were my one true friend.

705
01:01:40,600 --> 01:01:42,279
Are you gonna shoot me?

706
01:01:42,320 --> 01:01:43,919
I'm afraid so.

707
01:01:43,960 --> 01:01:45,879
I only have two days left.

708
01:01:45,920 --> 01:01:48,879
What did you say?
I can't understand the way you speak.

709
01:01:48,920 --> 01:01:52,639
I'm going to shoot you. I only
have two days left, I need more time.

710
01:01:52,680 --> 01:01:54,799
Do you actually believe another day
will make a difference?

711
01:01:54,840 --> 01:01:56,599
Have you seen how ugly you are?

712
01:01:56,640 --> 01:01:58,599
You haven't got a chance.
If I was a woman...

713
01:02:04,560 --> 01:02:06,479
Don't tell anyone I helped you.

714
01:02:06,520 --> 01:02:08,519
If you want to repay me, there is a way.

715
01:02:08,560 --> 01:02:10,799
If you kill a rabbit,
bring it to me to eat.

716
01:02:11,960 --> 01:02:13,599
Do you promise?

717
01:02:13,640 --> 01:02:15,359
- Yes.
- Bye.

718
01:02:15,400 --> 01:02:16,759
Bye.

719
01:04:48,080 --> 01:04:51,799
You carefully flay the rabbit
with a sharp knife and cut off its head.

720
01:04:55,200 --> 01:05:00,039
You then slice open its belly and stuff it
with well-washed red and green peppers,

721
01:05:00,720 --> 01:05:03,599
not too spicy,
and a little garlic and mint.

722
01:05:08,360 --> 01:05:12,399
You then soak it in lemon juice
and leave it a while to marinate the flesh

723
01:05:13,520 --> 01:05:17,919
before you skewer it on a stick
and roast it over the fire for about an hour.

724
01:05:20,240 --> 01:05:22,319
That's my favourite food,

725
01:05:23,240 --> 01:05:24,679
rabbit.

726
01:07:45,080 --> 01:07:47,919
Woman, brunette, 50 years old.

727
01:07:48,920 --> 01:07:51,239
Marriage certificate expired
two months ago.

728
01:07:51,280 --> 01:07:52,879
My husband's away on a business trip.

729
01:07:52,920 --> 01:07:55,239
Yeah, OK. Can I have a look?

730
01:08:02,680 --> 01:08:04,199
Hands.

731
01:08:12,320 --> 01:08:14,479
No dirt under her nails
or mud on her shoes.

732
01:08:15,480 --> 01:08:17,199
9 Belsize Road.

733
01:08:17,880 --> 01:08:19,799
- So your husband is away?
- Yes.

734
01:08:19,840 --> 01:08:21,479
Where?

735
01:08:21,520 --> 01:08:23,559
Good morning, sir. Are you here alone?

736
01:08:24,840 --> 01:08:26,439
Good morning, Officer.

737
01:08:26,480 --> 01:08:28,399
No, I'm here with my partner.

738
01:08:28,440 --> 01:08:31,239
She's inside one of the stores,
shopping right now.

739
01:08:31,840 --> 01:08:33,879
Can I see your certificate, please?

740
01:08:35,000 --> 01:08:36,919
My partner keeps it in her purse.

741
01:08:37,600 --> 01:08:40,559
You see, I am losing it all the time.

742
01:08:41,280 --> 01:08:42,519
I see.

743
01:08:42,560 --> 01:08:44,479
And what store is she shopping in?

744
01:08:51,480 --> 01:08:53,399
Oh, here she is.

745
01:08:54,600 --> 01:08:56,119
I'm sorry, darling.

746
01:08:56,160 --> 01:08:59,119
They had such a huge variety
of pain-relief ointment.

747
01:08:59,160 --> 01:09:02,479
I bought you this one.
I hope it's the one you were looking for.

748
01:09:02,520 --> 01:09:04,439
That's wonderful, dear.

749
01:09:04,480 --> 01:09:06,399
Can I have my certificate, please?

750
01:09:07,680 --> 01:09:10,999
Of course, darling.
Would you like to see mine also, Officer?

751
01:09:11,040 --> 01:09:12,959
No, that's OK.

752
01:09:13,000 --> 01:09:14,919
Thank you, sir.

753
01:09:14,960 --> 01:09:18,279
- You have a good day.
- Thank you, Officer. You have a good day.

754
01:09:18,320 --> 01:09:20,319
- Madam.
- Sir.

755
01:09:24,880 --> 01:09:28,159
If I'm walking too slowly,
just say, and I'll pick up my pace.

756
01:09:28,200 --> 01:09:30,119
This pace is fine.

757
01:09:31,360 --> 01:09:35,399
Maybe don't squeeze my hand so tightly,
my palm's getting a little sweaty.

758
01:09:35,440 --> 01:09:37,159
- Better?
- Yes.

759
01:09:37,200 --> 01:09:38,639
Much better.

760
01:09:39,800 --> 01:09:43,359
Are you planning on buying anything else
nice for yourself while we're here?

761
01:09:43,400 --> 01:09:47,119
Yes, contact lens solution
and a Parker Rollerball.

762
01:09:48,880 --> 01:09:50,919
I didn't know you were short-sighted.

763
01:09:52,240 --> 01:09:54,159
I'm short-sighted too.

764
01:10:19,200 --> 01:10:21,959
Will you stay a few days?

765
01:10:22,000 --> 01:10:23,759
I'm afraid not, Papa.

766
01:10:23,800 --> 01:10:25,719
We're heading back again today.

767
01:10:25,760 --> 01:10:28,119
Tomorrow I'm going away
on a business trip.

768
01:10:28,840 --> 01:10:30,759
You know how demanding my job is.

769
01:10:30,800 --> 01:10:33,479
Don't ask if I can stay a few days
every time I come.

770
01:10:35,040 --> 01:10:37,399
Do you all work for the same company?

771
01:10:39,040 --> 01:10:40,959
- Yes.
- Yes.

772
01:10:41,000 --> 01:10:44,599
My daughter says me
it's a very fine company.

773
01:10:44,640 --> 01:10:46,559
Do you agree?

774
01:10:47,240 --> 01:10:49,239
- It's a rather good company.
- It is.

775
01:10:50,160 --> 01:10:52,079
- One of the best, I'd say.
- Mm.

776
01:10:53,240 --> 01:10:54,999
The only problem with the job

777
01:10:55,040 --> 01:10:58,119
is that I don't have enough time
for my wife and kids.

778
01:11:02,240 --> 01:11:04,439
We have four beautiful children.

779
01:11:05,360 --> 01:11:07,399
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

780
01:11:07,440 --> 01:11:08,959
Thank you.

781
01:11:12,120 --> 01:11:14,039
But even if we'd never had children,

782
01:11:15,160 --> 01:11:17,199
I would never dream of leaving my wife.

783
01:11:18,240 --> 01:11:21,119
Even if it was just the two of us,
on our own,

784
01:11:22,080 --> 01:11:23,999
we'd go on trips.

785
01:11:24,040 --> 01:11:28,079
We'd go to Portofino in Italy
or go to a Greek island for the summer.

786
01:11:29,000 --> 01:11:33,079
And so our relationship
would be as intense as it was at the start.

787
01:11:35,840 --> 01:11:39,119
I love my wife so much

788
01:11:39,880 --> 01:11:41,799
I could die for her.

789
01:11:44,480 --> 01:11:46,399
That's how much I love her.

790
01:11:57,480 --> 01:11:59,919
For your first day in the city,
you did great.

791
01:12:00,520 --> 01:12:05,119
That part about holiday destinations
in the Mediterranean was brilliant.

792
01:12:05,160 --> 01:12:06,559
Thank you very much.

793
01:12:17,240 --> 01:12:19,159
When did you become short-sighted?

794
01:12:20,400 --> 01:12:22,319
When I was 16.

795
01:12:22,360 --> 01:12:23,759
You?

796
01:12:23,800 --> 01:12:25,719
When I was 12.

797
01:12:25,760 --> 01:12:28,319
What was the make
of your first pair of glasses?

798
01:12:30,240 --> 01:12:32,159
I don't remember.

799
01:12:33,160 --> 01:12:35,159
- Do you have astigmatism too?
- Yes.

800
01:12:43,880 --> 01:12:46,519
Would you like me to rub some balm
on your back

801
01:12:47,600 --> 01:12:49,759
on the bits you can't reach on your own?

802
01:12:51,720 --> 01:12:53,359
I'd like that.

803
01:13:08,520 --> 01:13:09,799
Here?

804
01:13:09,840 --> 01:13:11,759
A little lower, please.

805
01:13:11,800 --> 01:13:13,519
- Here?
- Yes.

806
01:13:41,640 --> 01:13:43,559
"Hello, everyone, and good luck.

807
01:13:43,600 --> 01:13:46,039
The room numbers are as follows:

808
01:13:46,400 --> 01:13:49,159
room 306, the hotel manager
and her partner.

809
01:13:49,200 --> 01:13:50,599
They both,

810
01:13:50,640 --> 01:13:52,559
they both have nice voices.

811
01:13:52,600 --> 01:13:55,039
Room 240: couple who both love to ski.

812
01:13:55,600 --> 01:13:59,799
Room 282: couple who
both studied social sciences.

813
01:14:00,440 --> 01:14:03,439
Name of yacht Bliss:
couple prone to nosebleeds."

814
01:14:14,880 --> 01:14:16,799
You and you take 306.

815
01:14:16,840 --> 01:14:18,759
You and you take 240.

816
01:14:18,800 --> 01:14:20,719
You take 282.

817
01:14:20,760 --> 01:14:22,679
And you two, take the yacht.

818
01:14:22,720 --> 01:14:24,239
Can I go to the yacht?

819
01:14:25,000 --> 01:14:27,239
OK, then, so you take the yacht.

820
01:14:27,280 --> 01:14:29,159
And you take 282.

821
01:14:29,960 --> 01:14:32,679
And us three,
we'll take the manager's room.

822
01:14:32,720 --> 01:14:34,239
We have 40 minutes.

823
01:14:50,440 --> 01:14:52,039
You need to speak with the manager.

824
01:15:22,520 --> 01:15:23,959
Wake up.

825
01:15:24,840 --> 01:15:26,279
Get up.

826
01:15:27,800 --> 01:15:29,719
Sit in that seat over there.

827
01:15:31,040 --> 01:15:32,959
Put your hand behind your back.

828
01:15:34,280 --> 01:15:37,559
A basketball weighs
between 550 and 650 grams.

829
01:15:37,600 --> 01:15:39,959
- Did you know that?
- No, I didn't know that.

830
01:15:41,240 --> 01:15:42,799
Yes.

831
01:15:43,800 --> 01:15:46,359
The weight's different
for men's and women's games,

832
01:15:46,400 --> 01:15:48,439
but that's roughly how much it weighs.

833
01:15:48,480 --> 01:15:50,639
Do you know how much a volleyball weighs?

834
01:15:51,320 --> 01:15:53,039
No, but I'd like to find out.

835
01:15:54,640 --> 01:15:56,559
- Good evening.
- Good evening.

836
01:15:56,600 --> 01:15:58,519
I have something to tell you.

837
01:15:58,560 --> 01:16:00,719
His nose doesn't really bleed on its own.

838
01:16:00,760 --> 01:16:04,679
He bangs it against a wall or a piece
of hard wood, or something like that.

839
01:16:04,720 --> 01:16:07,599
Or he cuts it with a penknife
when you're not looking.

840
01:16:07,640 --> 01:16:09,559
You two are not suited.

841
01:16:10,200 --> 01:16:12,999
Shut up. Dad, tell him to leave.
I'm sleepy.

842
01:16:13,040 --> 01:16:16,479
And, and I'm quite sure
that stain on his T-shirt isn't blood,

843
01:16:16,520 --> 01:16:18,039
but cherry juice or tomato ketchup

844
01:16:18,080 --> 01:16:20,919
or red watercolour paint
or something like that.

845
01:16:20,960 --> 01:16:22,879
Or beetroot juice.

846
01:16:25,160 --> 01:16:27,079
Do you love her?

847
01:16:28,240 --> 01:16:30,159
With all my heart.

848
01:16:31,240 --> 01:16:34,159
How much do you love her,
on a scale of 1 to 15?

849
01:16:38,600 --> 01:16:39,999
14.

850
01:16:41,160 --> 01:16:43,079
14 is a very impressive score.

851
01:16:43,800 --> 01:16:45,719
He loves her very much indeed.

852
01:16:46,600 --> 01:16:48,519
Who do you think we should kill?

853
01:16:48,560 --> 01:16:50,919
Who will be able to live
on their own better?

854
01:16:57,920 --> 01:16:59,839
Here's a knife, Mum. Kill him.

855
01:17:01,640 --> 01:17:03,479
You'd better get out while you still can.

856
01:17:03,520 --> 01:17:05,239
OK.

857
01:17:06,280 --> 01:17:08,199
That's all I came to say, anyway.

858
01:17:18,360 --> 01:17:19,759
You.

859
01:17:20,360 --> 01:17:23,599
If this woman dies,
d'you think you'll manage on your own?

860
01:17:23,640 --> 01:17:25,799
Or will you get involved
with someone else?

861
01:17:25,840 --> 01:17:27,039
No.

862
01:17:27,080 --> 01:17:28,999
I can live alone, she can't.

863
01:17:29,880 --> 01:17:32,679
I'm on my own for hours
when she's running the hotel.

864
01:17:33,720 --> 01:17:35,639
I like sitting in the room.

865
01:17:36,440 --> 01:17:38,839
It relaxes me, calms me.

866
01:17:40,320 --> 01:17:42,239
I like it a lot.

867
01:17:44,160 --> 01:17:46,919
I can definitely live on my own.

868
01:17:46,960 --> 01:17:49,399
Be quiet.

869
01:17:57,000 --> 01:17:58,439
Take it.

870
01:18:01,200 --> 01:18:02,839
Shoot her.

871
01:18:14,680 --> 01:18:16,119
No.

872
01:18:16,880 --> 01:18:18,279
No, no.

873
01:18:18,320 --> 01:18:20,239
No, God, no.

874
01:18:34,240 --> 01:18:36,679
I'm going to fucking kill your arse.

875
01:18:37,640 --> 01:18:39,559
Don't you fucking care?

876
01:19:03,800 --> 01:19:05,399
Where were you?

877
01:19:05,440 --> 01:19:06,879
I was looking for you.

878
01:19:06,920 --> 01:19:09,919
I was masturbating
behind those trees over there.

879
01:19:12,240 --> 01:19:14,159
Why aren't you dancing?

880
01:19:14,400 --> 01:19:15,919
My leg's a little sore.

881
01:19:17,160 --> 01:19:19,079
Did you dig your grave?

882
01:19:19,120 --> 01:19:21,039
Not yet.

883
01:19:21,080 --> 01:19:22,999
I don't mean to pressure you,

884
01:19:23,040 --> 01:19:25,599
or to ruin the mood
now that we're celebrating,

885
01:19:25,640 --> 01:19:27,639
but at some point you'll have to do it.

886
01:19:27,680 --> 01:19:31,639
Don't expect anyone else to dig your grave
for you or to carry your corpse.

887
01:19:31,680 --> 01:19:34,439
We'll throw some dirt over you
but that's about it.

888
01:19:35,120 --> 01:19:37,039
Tomorrow find a spot you like,

889
01:19:37,080 --> 01:19:40,239
where the ground isn't too rocky,
and make a start.

890
01:19:41,960 --> 01:19:44,399
- Enjoy the rest of your evening.
- Thank you.

891
01:19:56,800 --> 01:20:00,839
As soon as his last patient left,
I entered his office and I said to him,

892
01:20:01,960 --> 01:20:05,879
"Honey, the dinner's ready.
However, I'm not sure I can eat right now.

893
01:20:05,920 --> 01:20:07,839
One of my front teeth hurts a lot.

894
01:20:07,880 --> 01:20:09,799
Can you take a look please, dear?"

895
01:20:09,840 --> 01:20:11,759
"Yes, sure, no problem," he said.

896
01:20:11,800 --> 01:20:16,079
And the minute he turned his head,
I took the drill and I shoved it into his chest.

897
01:20:19,480 --> 01:20:22,519
That story sounds really interesting
but I have to leave.

898
01:20:22,560 --> 01:20:25,239
I just remembered I left some batteries
next to a tree down there.

899
01:20:25,280 --> 01:20:27,519
And the last thing I want is to lose them.
Sorry.

900
01:20:36,800 --> 01:20:38,959
Did you catch rabbits?

901
01:20:39,600 --> 01:20:41,599
- No, someone brought me them.
- Who?

902
01:20:41,640 --> 01:20:43,479
A friend of mine.

903
01:20:43,520 --> 01:20:45,439
- Do you want one?
- No.

904
01:20:47,360 --> 01:20:49,799
You don't need to accept rabbits
from other people.

905
01:20:49,840 --> 01:20:53,039
If you need more rabbits, just ask,
and I'll bring you more.

906
01:20:54,800 --> 01:20:57,759
Catching a rabbit is difficult,
but I'll try to do better.

907
01:20:57,800 --> 01:21:00,199
There's no need for you
to be indebted to the others.

908
01:21:00,240 --> 01:21:02,159
Thank you very much.

909
01:21:03,080 --> 01:21:04,999
The man who brought you the rabbits,

910
01:21:05,040 --> 01:21:06,959
is he short-sighted?

911
01:21:07,000 --> 01:21:09,479
I don't know. I don't think so.

912
01:21:09,520 --> 01:21:10,839
OK.

913
01:21:22,400 --> 01:21:24,319
Is that a sparrow up in that tree?

914
01:21:25,880 --> 01:21:27,719
I can't really see that far.

915
01:21:27,760 --> 01:21:29,319
But I don't think so.

916
01:21:29,360 --> 01:21:31,279
- Are you short-sighted?
- No.

917
01:21:31,320 --> 01:21:32,639
You're lying.

918
01:21:32,680 --> 01:21:34,479
It's the truth.

919
01:21:39,120 --> 01:21:41,039
What does it say here?

920
01:21:41,080 --> 01:21:42,999
YKK.

921
01:21:43,760 --> 01:21:46,519
You knew that already.
All zips say the same thing.

922
01:21:46,560 --> 01:21:48,279
I'm not short-sighted.

923
01:21:48,320 --> 01:21:50,759
I don't understand
why you won't believe me.

924
01:21:50,800 --> 01:21:53,239
I can see really clearly.
I used to be a pilot.

925
01:21:53,280 --> 01:21:55,199
You're wearing contact lenses.

926
01:21:55,240 --> 01:21:58,359
I don't wear contact lenses.
I'm not short-sighted, I swear.

927
01:21:58,400 --> 01:22:00,879
You are.
You think I'm an idiot and can't tell.

928
01:22:03,000 --> 01:22:04,639
Let me see.

929
01:22:06,000 --> 01:22:08,239
Let me see. I want to see your eyes.

930
01:22:10,080 --> 01:22:11,479
Look up.

931
01:22:12,160 --> 01:22:13,399
Look up.

932
01:22:14,640 --> 01:22:16,159
Up, up.

933
01:22:17,080 --> 01:22:18,719
Look down now.

934
01:22:20,000 --> 01:22:21,599
Look left.

935
01:22:22,960 --> 01:22:24,559
Look right.

936
01:22:24,600 --> 01:22:26,039
Up again.

937
01:22:33,640 --> 01:22:35,159
I'm sorry.

938
01:22:36,360 --> 01:22:38,279
I thought you were trying to fool me.

939
01:22:39,880 --> 01:22:41,559
I'm sorry.

940
01:22:44,760 --> 01:22:48,399
For this synchronisation exercise,
we have to fully concentrate,

941
01:22:48,440 --> 01:22:51,439
as we both have to press "play"
at exactly the same time.

942
01:22:52,480 --> 01:22:54,399
Why don't we just use one headset?

943
01:22:55,560 --> 01:22:57,479
Because that's the whole point.

944
01:22:57,520 --> 01:22:59,439
This is an exercise for us.

945
01:22:59,480 --> 01:23:01,399
We have to be totally synchronised.

946
01:23:02,320 --> 01:23:03,759
OK.

947
01:23:09,320 --> 01:23:11,239
- I'm ready.
- OK.

948
01:23:14,000 --> 01:23:16,639
Five, four, three,

949
01:23:17,200 --> 01:23:18,319
two,

950
01:23:22,480 --> 01:23:25,239
♪ Where The Wild Roses Grow

951
01:23:49,520 --> 01:23:53,919
♪ If I show you the roses will you follow?

952
01:23:56,000 --> 01:24:00,039
♪ They call me the Wild Rose

953
01:24:02,680 --> 01:24:05,599
♪ But my name is Elisa Day

954
01:24:13,200 --> 01:24:16,479
We've developed a code
so that we can communicate with each other,

955
01:24:16,520 --> 01:24:20,239
even in front of the others,
without them knowing what we are saying.

956
01:24:20,760 --> 01:24:23,399
When we turn our heads to the left,
it means,

957
01:24:23,440 --> 01:24:25,879
"I love you more
than anything in the world."

958
01:24:25,920 --> 01:24:28,559
And when we turn our heads to the right,
it means,

959
01:24:28,600 --> 01:24:30,479
"Watch out, we're in danger."

960
01:24:32,800 --> 01:24:35,679
We had to be very careful in the beginning
not to mix up

961
01:24:35,720 --> 01:24:39,959
"I love you more than anything in the world"
with "Watch out, we're in danger."

962
01:24:42,000 --> 01:24:43,919
When we raise our left arm, it means,

963
01:24:44,800 --> 01:24:46,719
"I want to dance in your arms."

964
01:24:46,760 --> 01:24:49,759
When we make a fist and put it
behind our backs, it means,

965
01:24:49,800 --> 01:24:51,719
"Let's fuck."

966
01:24:52,960 --> 01:24:55,759
The code grew and grew as time went by.

967
01:24:55,800 --> 01:24:58,999
And within a few weeks,
we could talk about almost anything

968
01:24:59,040 --> 01:25:01,359
without even opening our mouths.

969
01:26:28,600 --> 01:26:30,199
Stop it.

970
01:26:30,240 --> 01:26:32,399
That's enough.
Show my parents some respect.

971
01:26:32,440 --> 01:26:34,359
They are playing you music.

972
01:26:35,280 --> 01:26:38,919
- That's OK.
- No, Mother, it is not OK.

973
01:26:39,800 --> 01:26:41,199
Please continue.

974
01:26:41,240 --> 01:26:44,359
Do you want us to perform
the same piece or something else?

975
01:26:45,800 --> 01:26:47,239
Something else.

976
01:27:09,800 --> 01:27:11,839
Didn't her parents play beautifully?

977
01:27:14,960 --> 01:27:16,599
Yes, they did.

978
01:27:16,640 --> 01:27:18,559
It was wonderful.

979
01:27:24,280 --> 01:27:26,319
We love each other and we suit each other.

980
01:27:26,360 --> 01:27:29,159
And that's the reason
why we've decided to leave the woods

981
01:27:29,200 --> 01:27:31,239
and stay together forever in the city.

982
01:27:40,920 --> 01:27:42,839
Tomorrow during the hunt,

983
01:27:42,880 --> 01:27:47,399
we're going to disappear and everyone
will think we've been captured,

984
01:27:47,440 --> 01:27:50,959
and that we're going to be turned
into dogs or canaries or something.

985
01:28:05,840 --> 01:28:07,639
I think the first thing I'm going to do

986
01:28:07,680 --> 01:28:10,159
when I get into the city
is buy a bathrobe.

987
01:28:10,200 --> 01:28:14,519
And then we'll go to a pool with a
high diving board, perfect for diving.

988
01:28:14,560 --> 01:28:17,199
"And we'll do
lots of different things together,

989
01:28:17,240 --> 01:28:19,159
serious things, not silly ones,

990
01:28:19,200 --> 01:28:22,719
like go for walks in the park
or play the guitar together."

991
01:28:30,600 --> 01:28:34,239
"Portofino. Italian fishing village
and upmarket resort,

992
01:28:34,280 --> 01:28:36,279
famous for its picturesque harbour.

993
01:28:37,000 --> 01:28:38,919
Population: 439.

994
01:28:38,960 --> 01:28:40,879
Beaches nearby:

995
01:28:40,920 --> 01:28:45,079
Paraggi Beach, Camogli,
Chiavari and Lavagna.

996
01:28:46,160 --> 01:28:50,319
Serifos: Greek island located
in the western Cyclades."

997
01:29:09,800 --> 01:29:13,319
Can you imagine why I brought you
to such a quiet place today?

998
01:29:20,160 --> 01:29:21,239
No.

999
01:29:22,480 --> 01:29:25,359
Because I think it's the perfect spot
for your grave.

1000
01:30:12,000 --> 01:30:13,919
Now cover yourself with soil.

1001
01:30:14,520 --> 01:30:16,439
Use you hands.

1002
01:30:32,480 --> 01:30:34,199
Over your face too.

1003
01:30:34,240 --> 01:30:37,439
You wouldn't want your face to get
eaten by dogs, would you?

1004
01:31:03,120 --> 01:31:06,119
If you die before me,
I'll visit you as often as I can.

1005
01:31:06,160 --> 01:31:07,919
I promise.

1006
01:31:18,840 --> 01:31:21,439
I think we should leave right now.

1007
01:31:23,240 --> 01:31:25,399
The three of us coming here instead of

1008
01:31:26,200 --> 01:31:28,959
two or four is very dangerous.

1009
01:31:30,160 --> 01:31:32,439
Why didn't we think of that earlier?

1010
01:31:33,560 --> 01:31:36,079
Highly likely the doctor will suspect us.

1011
01:31:37,200 --> 01:31:40,559
I suggest that we leave
the first chance we get.

1012
01:31:42,000 --> 01:31:43,919
Right now, in fact.

1013
01:31:44,800 --> 01:31:46,719
Don't be afraid.

1014
01:31:47,440 --> 01:31:49,359
No one will suspect a thing.

1015
01:31:50,280 --> 01:31:52,599
I bet you weren't expecting this surprise.

1016
01:31:54,280 --> 01:31:56,639
- Isn't it wonderful?
- Yes, it is.

1017
01:31:58,280 --> 01:32:01,399
Still, I'd like a few days
just to think it over, so that

1018
01:32:02,520 --> 01:32:07,239
I could maybe have the surgery
when we next come to the city.

1019
01:32:09,960 --> 01:32:11,879
What's there to think about?

1020
01:32:11,920 --> 01:32:15,359
If it's better to see clearly
or to be short-sighted? Is that it?

1021
01:32:17,000 --> 01:32:19,319
That's absurd, you know that.

1022
01:32:19,360 --> 01:32:21,359
Anyway, this doctor is the best there is.

1023
01:32:21,400 --> 01:32:23,919
And it's really very difficult
to get an appointment.

1024
01:32:23,960 --> 01:32:26,639
I called him months ago
to get him to see you today.

1025
01:33:17,000 --> 01:33:18,919
She's blind.

1026
01:33:18,960 --> 01:33:20,879
Thank you.

1027
01:33:46,200 --> 01:33:48,879
Throw down your knife and stand up.

1028
01:33:51,520 --> 01:33:53,839
Why did you have to blind me?

1029
01:33:53,880 --> 01:33:55,759
You could have blinded him.

1030
01:33:56,320 --> 01:33:58,479
I have no idea what you're talking about.

1031
01:33:58,520 --> 01:34:00,519
The drugs are messing with your head.

1032
01:34:01,080 --> 01:34:05,159
If I were you, I would try and be
a little braver about the whole thing.

1033
01:34:05,200 --> 01:34:06,959
Now get up and give me your knife

1034
01:34:08,120 --> 01:34:10,119
or I'll hit you and take it by force.

1035
01:34:11,160 --> 01:34:13,999
- Here I come.
- I swear I'm going to kill you.

1036
01:34:26,240 --> 01:34:28,999
Let go of my hair, you're hurting me.

1037
01:34:48,000 --> 01:34:51,079
Just think, that when someone goes blind

1038
01:34:52,240 --> 01:34:54,159
one of the other senses

1039
01:34:54,200 --> 01:34:56,119
is heightened.

1040
01:35:31,360 --> 01:35:33,359
You could also catch a dog in the woods

1041
01:35:33,400 --> 01:35:35,319
and train it to guide you.

1042
01:35:36,440 --> 01:35:38,359
Dogs can do that, you know.

1043
01:35:39,320 --> 01:35:41,239
I'll help you catch a dog myself.

1044
01:35:42,800 --> 01:35:45,919
Now calm down,
or I'm going to leave you here

1045
01:35:45,960 --> 01:35:49,559
and I don't think you'll manage
to find Meeting Point 2 on your own.

1046
01:36:02,560 --> 01:36:04,479
Are you enjoying the view?

1047
01:36:05,960 --> 01:36:07,279
Sure.

1048
01:36:09,640 --> 01:36:11,559
What happened to your hand?

1049
01:36:12,880 --> 01:36:16,919
I was cutting a tree branch with a knife
and I cut myself by accident.

1050
01:36:16,960 --> 01:36:19,719
You look handsome today,
did you get your hair cut?

1051
01:36:19,760 --> 01:36:21,479
Thank you.

1052
01:36:21,520 --> 01:36:23,439
No, I didn't get a haircut.

1053
01:36:23,480 --> 01:36:25,399
I'm going to get my hair cut today.

1054
01:36:25,440 --> 01:36:26,959
Look what I brought you.

1055
01:36:27,000 --> 01:36:30,199
Oh, thank you so much.
I'm so hungry, I'll eat it right away.

1056
01:36:30,240 --> 01:36:32,159
It's a bigger flashlight.

1057
01:36:32,200 --> 01:36:34,119
Oh, I'm sorry.

1058
01:36:34,160 --> 01:36:36,159
It's so big, I thought it was a rabbit.

1059
01:36:37,200 --> 01:36:39,239
The biggest flashlight I've ever seen.

1060
01:36:39,280 --> 01:36:40,519
Oh.

1061
01:36:41,440 --> 01:36:43,359
Are you ready for tonight?

1062
01:36:43,400 --> 01:36:45,319
Of course I am.

1063
01:36:48,880 --> 01:36:51,839
I want to tell you something
but please don't be angry.

1064
01:36:52,680 --> 01:36:54,599
OK. What's wrong?

1065
01:36:54,640 --> 01:36:56,559
I can't see anything.

1066
01:36:57,920 --> 01:36:59,839
I'm blind.

1067
01:36:59,880 --> 01:37:01,799
What do you mean?

1068
01:37:02,520 --> 01:37:06,039
There's no point in lying to you,
you'll find out sooner or later.

1069
01:37:07,520 --> 01:37:09,639
Our leader blinded me in the city.

1070
01:37:10,760 --> 01:37:14,959
She must have realised
that I love you and you love me

1071
01:37:15,000 --> 01:37:18,519
and that we were going to run away
to the city together.

1072
01:37:20,840 --> 01:37:22,319
I'm sorry.

1073
01:37:24,440 --> 01:37:26,359
You can't see at all?

1074
01:37:27,680 --> 01:37:29,599
No, not at all.

1075
01:37:30,920 --> 01:37:33,039
And when you asked if I'd had my hair cut?

1076
01:37:35,880 --> 01:37:37,799
I was just saying that

1077
01:37:39,480 --> 01:37:41,839
so you wouldn't realise
that I can't see.

1078
01:37:44,640 --> 01:37:46,559
I'm sorry.

1079
01:37:46,600 --> 01:37:48,279
Don't cry.

1080
01:37:48,320 --> 01:37:50,319
Crying will make your eyes hurt more.

1081
01:37:54,000 --> 01:37:55,679
We'll find a way.

1082
01:38:11,880 --> 01:38:13,799
What blood type are you?

1083
01:38:14,560 --> 01:38:15,599
B.

1084
01:38:27,000 --> 01:38:30,239
♪ From the first time I saw her,
I knew she was the one

1085
01:38:31,120 --> 01:38:33,679
♪ As she stared in my eyes and smiled

1086
01:38:34,520 --> 01:38:37,199
♪ And her lips were the colour of roses

1087
01:38:38,240 --> 01:38:41,319
♪ That grew down the river
all bloody and wild

1088
01:38:45,880 --> 01:38:48,439
Do you like berries?
Blueberries, blackberries?

1089
01:38:48,480 --> 01:38:50,399
- No, no.
- Mm.

1090
01:38:51,680 --> 01:38:53,599
Can you play the piano?

1091
01:38:54,400 --> 01:38:55,959
No.

1092
01:39:02,680 --> 01:39:04,239
Plastic cup.

1093
01:39:04,280 --> 01:39:06,199
That's right. Very good.

1094
01:39:09,040 --> 01:39:10,959
Do you speak German?

1095
01:39:13,480 --> 01:39:14,919
No.

1096
01:39:16,080 --> 01:39:17,999
I could teach you German.

1097
01:39:18,680 --> 01:39:21,679
But it would take at least a year for you
to be able to speak the basics,

1098
01:39:21,720 --> 01:39:23,639
not fluently, so there's no point.

1099
01:39:23,680 --> 01:39:27,399
You know, German is one of the most
difficult languages in the world to learn,

1100
01:39:27,440 --> 01:39:29,999
because its grammar is very complicated.

1101
01:39:33,440 --> 01:39:35,359
I brought you something.

1102
01:39:37,040 --> 01:39:38,839
It's a fish.

1103
01:39:38,880 --> 01:39:40,159
Oh.

♪ On the second day,
I brought her a flower

1105
01:39:47,040 --> 01:39:50,119
♪ She was more beautiful
than any woman I'd seen

1106
01:39:50,600 --> 01:39:53,799
♪ And I said,
Do you know where the wild roses grow

1107
01:39:54,240 --> 01:39:56,599
♪ So sweet and scarlet and free

1108
01:40:02,760 --> 01:40:04,079
Kiwi.

1109
01:40:04,120 --> 01:40:06,439
That's right, ten out of ten again.

1110
01:40:08,600 --> 01:40:10,519
Can I give you a kiss?

1111
01:40:13,680 --> 01:40:16,759
I can't thank you enough
for all the activities and games

1112
01:40:16,800 --> 01:40:18,519
and for keeping me company,

1113
01:40:18,560 --> 01:40:21,079
but you know we can't do that any more.

1114
01:40:24,680 --> 01:40:27,759
Would you like to play another round of
Touch-Guess-Think-Win?

1115
01:40:27,800 --> 01:40:29,719
No, that's enough for today.

1116
01:40:31,760 --> 01:40:34,399
In any case, I've run out of things
to test you with.

1117
01:40:34,440 --> 01:40:35,679
Oh.

1118
01:40:35,720 --> 01:40:37,639
Maybe tomorrow

1119
01:40:37,680 --> 01:40:39,919
or one of these days.

1120
01:40:39,960 --> 01:40:41,999
Tomorrow morning?

1121
01:40:42,040 --> 01:40:43,639
We'll see.

1122
01:40:47,800 --> 01:40:49,519
- Bye.
- Bye.

1123
01:41:21,280 --> 01:41:23,199
Good afternoon.

1124
01:41:25,000 --> 01:41:26,919
How are you?

1125
01:41:26,960 --> 01:41:28,279
Fine.

1126
01:41:29,640 --> 01:41:31,079
I'm hungry.

1127
01:41:31,920 --> 01:41:34,079
You haven't brought me a rabbit for days.

1128
01:41:35,400 --> 01:41:37,319
Or things for me to touch and guess.

1129
01:41:39,080 --> 01:41:40,999
I've got good news.

1130
01:41:41,040 --> 01:41:42,959
I've had a great idea.

1131
01:41:43,880 --> 01:41:45,559
Have you a minute?

1132
01:41:46,320 --> 01:41:48,239
What kind of idea?

1133
01:41:50,760 --> 01:41:52,679
I raise my left foot,

1134
01:41:54,320 --> 01:41:57,039
I bring my elbow
to my knee and tap it twice.

1135
01:41:58,400 --> 01:42:00,959
I bring my foot to my knee
and tap it three times.

1136
01:42:01,000 --> 01:42:03,159
I lie face down, I kneel down.

1137
01:42:04,560 --> 01:42:06,759
I touch my left cheek

1138
01:42:06,800 --> 01:42:08,439
and then lie face up.

1139
01:42:15,080 --> 01:42:17,199
Are you sure you're prepared to do that?

1140
01:42:22,560 --> 01:42:24,479
Yes, of course I'm sure.

1141
01:42:25,160 --> 01:42:27,079
I wouldn't propose it otherwise.

1142
01:42:31,880 --> 01:42:33,239
When?

1143
01:42:34,520 --> 01:42:36,039
Tomorrow.

1144
01:42:41,920 --> 01:42:43,759
Tomorrow.

1145
01:44:30,480 --> 01:44:32,399
We should speed up a little.

1146
01:44:36,160 --> 01:44:38,079
I can't go much faster.

1147
01:44:38,120 --> 01:44:40,279
The trousers are too tight. I'm sorry.

1148
01:44:41,520 --> 01:44:43,559
It was dark and I couldn't see clearly.

1149
01:44:43,600 --> 01:44:45,519
And I didn't have time to try them on.

1150
01:44:46,880 --> 01:44:48,439
I'm sorry.

1151
01:44:50,320 --> 01:44:52,079
Never mind.

1152
01:44:54,440 --> 01:44:56,359
There's a bus coming.

1153
01:45:20,000 --> 01:45:21,919
It was the hotel coach.

1154
01:45:22,680 --> 01:45:24,599
They didn't see us.

1155
01:45:48,720 --> 01:45:50,479
Profile.

1156
01:46:00,080 --> 01:46:01,679
Fingers.

1157
01:46:08,880 --> 01:46:10,439
Elbows.

1158
01:46:29,440 --> 01:46:31,439
Would you like me to show you my belly?

1159
01:46:31,480 --> 01:46:32,919
No.

1160
01:46:33,560 --> 01:46:35,479
I, I remember your belly very well.

1161
01:46:38,680 --> 01:46:40,279
Smile.

1162
01:46:58,320 --> 01:47:02,039
Can I have a knife and fork, please?
Not a butter knife, a steak knife.

1163
01:47:02,080 --> 01:47:03,359
Certainly.

1164
01:47:16,200 --> 01:47:17,679
Thank you.

1165
01:47:26,560 --> 01:47:28,479
I'm going to do it with a knife.

1166
01:47:29,040 --> 01:47:30,959
Do you want me to come with you?

1167
01:47:31,000 --> 01:47:32,919
I'd rather you didn't.

1168
01:47:33,680 --> 01:47:35,599
Don't worry.

1169
01:47:35,640 --> 01:47:38,799
It's strange at first,
but then you get used to it.

1170
01:47:39,840 --> 01:47:41,879
And your other senses are heightened -

1171
01:47:41,920 --> 01:47:44,399
touch, for example, and hearing.

1172
01:47:45,480 --> 01:47:47,239
I know.

1173
01:47:56,680 --> 01:47:58,599
I won't be long.

1174
01:49:22,480 --> 01:49:24,399
Thank you very much.

1175
01:50:10,360 --> 01:50:13,439
