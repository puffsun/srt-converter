{\pos(648.02,611.875)}「佩小姐的奇幻城堡」

6
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:01,710
你是否感到过自己所做的都毫无意义
Do you ever feel like nothing you do matters?

7
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,430
就像在海滩上留下的脚印
You leave footprints on the beach,

8
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:05,830
第二天便消失不见
and tomorrow they're gone.

9
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:08,710
就像不断重复的一天又一天
Like it's just today over again.

10
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:12,460
人们说十几岁时
They say your teen years

11
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:14,860
就是要交朋友、尽情玩耍
are for making friends and having fun...

12
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:17,420
对我来说这样更糟
which made me feel even worse.

13
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:20,270
嗨，艾米，我是杰克
Hey, Amy. It's Jake.

14
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:21,990
咱俩数学课一起上
I'm in your math class.

15
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:24,400
嘿，别忘了给自己买成人纸尿裤
Hey, don't forget your adult diapers.

16
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:25,480
呵呵
Yeah, right.

17
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,790
杰克，有电话找你
Jake. Phone for you.

18
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:38,870
但那一天开始，一切都变了
But that day, everything changed.

19
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:43,630
谢谢你送我，雪莉
Thanks for the ride, Shelley.

20
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:46,980
怎么让你去照顾你爷爷呢？
So, how come you have to go deal with your grandpa?

21
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:49,550
我爸他工作忙，走不开
My dad couldn't get out of work.

22
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:51,790
他还有工作？
I didn't think he worked.

23
00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:59,110
我还是给爷爷打个电话吧
I'm just gonna call Grandpa.

24
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:03,030
我是亚伯
Hello, this is Abe.

25
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:04,670
我是杰克
Hey, it's Jake.

26
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:08,070
别过来！听我说
No! Don't come here. Listen to me.

27
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:09,910
这里不安全
It's not safe.

28
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:11,110
千万别来
Stay away.

29
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:13,630
爷爷，你今天吃药了吗？
Grandpa, did you take your pills today?

30
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:17,500
放枪的橱柜的钥匙，本来在抽屉里
The key to my gun cabinet, it was in the drawer.

31
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:18,990
现在不见了！
And now it's gone.

32
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:22,350
我爸拿走了，你不记得了？
Yeah, Dad took it, all right?

33
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:25,630
安全起见，好吧
For safekeeping. It's okay.

34
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:28,370
你爸拿走了？没有枪我怎么对付他们？
Your father wants I should fight them without a gun?

35
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:35,590
上帝保佑他
God bless him.

36
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:38,150
他是怎么了？老年痴呆？
What's his deal, Alzheimer's?

37
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:39,990
智力衰弱
Dementia.

38
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:02,950
那家伙吓我一跳
That guy gave me the heebie-jeebies.

39
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:14,590
有什么事就喊我
Holler if you need me.

40
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:23,900
爷爷？
Grandpa?

41
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:49,360
雪莉！
Shelley!

42
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:56,280
怎么回事？
What's goin' on?

43
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:57,860
有人闯进来了
Someone broke in.

44
00:05:58,200 --> 00:06:00,580
我车里有枪，在这儿等我
I've got a.38 in my car. You wait there.

45
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:50,700
爷爷！
Grandpa!

46
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:05,290
911，您遇到了什么紧急情况？
911. What's your emergency?

47
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:07,510
我需要医务人员
911? Yeah, I need the paramedics.

48
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:09,980
地址是棕榈环路2040号，我爷爷…
It's at 2040 Palm Circle. My grandpa...

49
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:12,370
您遇到了什么紧急情况？
Sir, what's your emergency?

50
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:13,400
爷爷
Grandpa.

51
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:15,470
你得赶快走
You have to get away from here.

52
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:16,920
能听见我说话吗，先生？
Sir, can you hear me?

53
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:18,790
听我说
Please. Listen.

54
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,670
去岛上
Go to the island.

55
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:22,630
先生，医务人员正在赶来
Sir, paramedics are on their way.

56
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:24,910
找到艾默生
Find Emerson.

57
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:27,830
那张明信片
The postcard.

58
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,510
找到圈
Go to the loop.

59
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:32,390
1943年9月3号
September 3rd, 1943.

60
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:34,100
没事的
It's okay.

61
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:36,190
不要动，救护车马上来了
Just don't move. There's an ambulance coming.

62
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:39,270
你肯定觉得我疯了
I know you think I'm crazy.

63
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:42,470
但鸟会跟你解释的
But the bird will explain everything.

64
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:46,710
答应我，小老虎，你一定去
Will you do this, Tygrysku? Promise me?

65
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:48,310
我一定去
I promise, yes.

66
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:50,910
我以为自己能保护你
I thought I could protect you.

67
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:57,150
我早就应该告诉你
I should have told you years ago.

68
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:06,310
爷爷！告诉我什么？
Grandpa. Tell me what?

69
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:07,900
爷爷！
Grandpa!

70
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:30,070
雪莉，小心后面
Shelley, behind you!

71
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:47,190
那里没有人
There was no one there.

72
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:49,950
听我说，杰克…
May I say, Jake...

73
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:52,270
鉴于才过去一个月
that considering this was only a month ago...

74
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:54,900
我认为你的表现已经很好了
I think you're doing exceptionally well.

75
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:57,780
你是说不疯了？
Apart from being crazy?

76
00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:02,220
做恶梦和焦虑并不代表你疯了
Having nightmares and anxiety doesn't make you crazy.

77
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:05,910
那看到并不存在的东西呢？
What about seeing things which aren't there?

78
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:07,170
在某些特殊情况下
Actually, in traumatic situations,

79
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:08,420
这种现象也很常见
it's not at all uncommon.

80
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:12,190
你头脑中的潜意识会提取电影中的画面，或是…
Your subconscious mind drew an image from a movie or...

81
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:13,830
是因为一个故事
It was a story.

82
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:17,580
我小时候，爷爷会给我讲故事
My grandpa told me stories when I was a kid...

83
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:20,470
讲他在战争中遇到的那些怪物
about monsters that he fought in the war.

84
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:21,640
你看
So there you go.

85
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:23,510
他当时伤的很重
He was brutally attacked...

86
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:26,990
所以你认为伤他的是非人类，是怪物
and in your head, the man who did it was inhuman, a monster.

87
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:29,430
不过也不是人
It wasn't a man, though.

88
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:31,910
警察说纱门上
The cops said that dogs

89
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,190
有狗抓过的痕迹
scratched up the screen door...

90
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:37,310
他追到树林里
and he chased them off into the woods.

91
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:39,670
验尸官说他当时心脏病发作
And the coroner said he had a heart attack.

92
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:41,830
警察说
And the cops said...

93
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:46,870
狗会吃掉尸体软组织
that dogs go for the soft parts.

94
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:49,550
他们检查了叉子上提取到的DNA
They DNA tested the fork...

95
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:52,550
里面有动物的DNA
and it had animal DNA.

96
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:54,990
就这么结案了
So, that's case closed.

97
00:09:56,120 --> 00:09:58,830
听你说的，你爷爷应该是个了不起的人
He sounds like an extraordinary gentleman.

98
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:01,270
你俩很亲近吗？
Were you very close?

99
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:02,920
波多黎各
Puerto Rico.

100
00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:05,280
这里
Here.

101
00:10:05,560 --> 00:10:08,430
那里有个湖，湖水晚上会发光
There's a lake where the water glows in the dark.

102
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:10,510
还有一个秘密通道
And a secret tunnel.

103
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:12,980
我藏在里面躲过了怪物
That's where I hid from the monsters.

104
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:15,350
我小时候他经常照顾我
He used to babysit me a lot.

105
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:17,790
跟他在一起的时候，我有种特别的感觉
When I was with him, I felt special.

106
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:21,110
我的鸭子又干了
My duck was dry again.

107
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:25,670
亚伯，都11点了，他怎么还没睡
Abe. It's, like, 11:00. What is he doing up?

108
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,630
我要当一个探险家
I'm gonna be an explorer.

109
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:31,630
爷爷在帮我计划第一次航行
Grandpa's helping me plan my first voyage.

110
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:33,950
世上的角角落落都已经被探过了
Everything's already been discovered, buddy.

111
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:37,250
他们恐吓彼此
They terrorize each other...

112
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:39,950
然后大肆破坏，毁掉了岛上的其他地方
before wreaking havoc on the rest of the island.

113
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:41,400
别理你爸爸
Pay no attention to your father.

114
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:42,500
他什么都不知道
He knows bubkes.

115
00:10:42,680 --> 00:10:46,030
走吧，小老虎，该睡了
Come, Tygrysku. Off to bed.

116
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:56,910
给我讲个故事吧
Can you tell me a story?

117
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,000
经常讲的那个？
The usual?

118
00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:02,790
很久很久以前
Okay. Once upon a time...

119
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:04,230
有一个小男孩
there was a little boy...

120
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:05,790
要带图片
With the pictures.

121
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:07,580
图片啊
Pictures.

122
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:17,030
很久很久以前
Once upon a time...

123
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:19,830
有个小男孩名叫亚伯
there was a little boy called Abe.

124
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,310
就是你嘛
That was you.

125
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:22,760
是我
That was me.

126
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:26,150
他住在一个很美丽的福利院
And he lived in a lovely children's home

127
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:27,870
就在威尔士附近一座小岛上
on a little island near Wales...

128
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:30,230
那里每天都阳光灿烂
where the sun shone every day.

129
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:34,190
那里的女校长叫佩瑞格林小姐
The headmistress, Miss Peregrine...

130
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:36,230
她非常非常聪明
was very clever.

131
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:38,860
她还抽烟斗
And she smoked a pipe.

132
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:40,180
她还能变成鸟
She could turn into a bird.

133
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:45,670
那里是特殊儿童之家
It was a home for special children...

134
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:49,070
比如布朗温，还有维克多
like Bronwyn and Victor.

135
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:52,790
他俩都非常强壮，比得过十个壮汉
They were both as strong as 10 men.

136
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:54,740
还有休
And Hugh...

137
00:11:54,920 --> 00:11:58,310
休身体住着蜜蜂
Hugh had bees living inside him.

138
00:11:59,640 --> 00:12:00,640
艾玛呢？
Where's Emma?

139
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:02,550
她会飘起来
She could float.

140
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:06,630
她比空气还轻
She was lighter than air.

141
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:10,030
必须得穿上铅做的鞋子
She had to wear special shoes made of lead

142
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:11,950
否则会飘走
to keep her from floating away.

143
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:14,710
她现在在哪里？
Where is she now?

144
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:17,380
应该还在岛上吧
She's still on the island, I believe.

145
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:20,470
我的爸爸妈妈把我送到那里
My mama and papa sent me there...

146
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:22,910
和特殊的小孩子们一起生活
to live with the special children.

147
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:26,430
小老虎该睡觉了
And now, Tygrysku, time for sleep.

148
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:28,430
他总是叫我小老虎
He used to call me Tygrysku.

149
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:30,510
就是波兰语的小老虎的意思
It's Polish for "little tiger."

150
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,190
一点都不像我
He couldn't have picked a less appropriate nickname.

151
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:34,750
我那时候胆子很小
I was always a chicken.

152
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:37,590
你的爸爸妈妈为什么把你送走
Why did your mom and dad send you away?

153
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:42,340
我们那时住在波兰，那里不安全
Well, where we lived in Poland, it wasn't safe.

154
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:44,310
那里有怪物
There were monsters.

155
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:46,750
哪种怪物？
What kind of monsters?

156
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:50,700
超级大的怪物，有很长的手臂
Huge ones, with long arms...

157
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:52,790
没有眼睛
and no eyes...

158
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,560
触手就像这样
and tentacles like this.

159
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:00,510
可笑的是
The dumb thing was...

160
00:13:00,680 --> 00:13:02,830
好多年，我都相信他的故事
for years, I actually believed his stories.

161
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:06,590
这个是米勒德，他是隐形人
And this is Millard. He's invisible.

162
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:16,870
老师说那些照片是专门唬人的
My teacher says they were trick photos.

163
00:13:17,640 --> 00:13:19,150
你相信她说的吗？
And did you believe her?

164
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:21,310
爸爸说你大概是在某家
Dad says you probably found them

165
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:22,670
旧货商店找到的
at a junk store someplace...

166
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:25,220
就在你旅行的时候
when you went traveling.

167
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:27,860
我永远不会骗你，小老虎
I would never lie to you, Tygrysku.

168
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:33,470
但是你就是骗我了，福利院，还有怪物
But you did, about the home, the monsters.

169
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:36,110
爸爸说
Dad told me.

170
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:38,590
你爸爸知道
Your father knows very well

171
00:13:38,680 --> 00:13:40,870
我小时候住在儿童之家
I went to live in the children's home.

172
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:44,990
他说那时候波兰的确有怪物
He said there really were monsters in Poland...

173
00:13:45,280 --> 00:13:48,270
但不是长触角的那种怪物
just not the kind with tentacles.

174
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:52,150
他说你被送去威尔士是因为波兰有坏人
He said you got sent to Wales 'cause there were bad people.

175
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:56,590
那些人会杀掉所有跟他们不一样的人
People who wanted to kill anyone who was different.

176
00:13:57,600 --> 00:13:59,710
我不想继续谈这个了
I don't wanna talk about this anymore.

177
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:02,670
他说那里的孩子是很特殊
He said the children were special...

178
00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:06,600
但不是你说的那种特殊
but not the way you said.

179
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:46,260
发现什么好东西了？
You find something good?

180
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:51,150
哦，快瞧瞧，真棒
Oh, look at that. That's awesome.

181
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:53,350
带走吧
You should take that.

182
00:14:53,520 --> 00:14:55,390
走吧，小伙子
Come on, buddy, let's roll.

183
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:58,830
你怎么跟没事儿人一样？
How are you so okay?

184
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:02,870
杰克，你跟爷爷的关系比我跟他亲近多了
Jakey, you were a lot closer to him than I ever was.

185
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:04,870
他是个好爷爷
He was a wonderful grandpa...

186
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:06,870
但不算是个好爸爸
but not such a great dad.

187
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:10,420
他所有的工作
Never seemed to pick a job...

188
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:11,910
都早出晚归
that didn't involve late nights

189
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,670
还经常出差很久
or long trips away, though.

190
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:16,310
我和你苏希姑姑
Me and Aunt Susie always kind of thought

191
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:19,230
都以为他出轨了
he was, maybe, cheating on our mom.

192
00:15:21,560 --> 00:15:23,680
对不起，我知道你很崇拜爷爷
I'm sorry, buddy. I know how much you worshiped him...

193
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:25,470
但事实就是这样
but there it is.

194
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:35,790
惊喜吧！！
Surprise!

195
00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:37,100
生日快乐，杰克表哥
Happy birthday, Cousin Jake!

196
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:39,010
杰克，真高兴
J-dog, it's great you're coming

197
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:40,080
你暑假和我们一起过
to spend a summer with us.

198
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:41,430
等会儿带你去看新船
Wait till you see the new boat.

199
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:43,360
很期待呢
Can't wait.

200
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:54,790
是苏希姑姑
It's Aunt Susie.

201
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:57,670
我猜这个礼物你会喜欢
Thought you might wanna open this one.

202
00:15:57,840 --> 00:15:59,990
是爷爷送你的
It's from your grandpa.

203
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:02,310
我看到的时候已经包好了
Found it while I was packing up.

204
00:16:02,520 --> 00:16:05,080
我猜他是想给你的
I figured he meant to give it to you someday.

205
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:08,460
谢谢姑姑
Thanks.

206
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:30,630
致杰克，以及他即将发现的世界
To Jake, and the worlds he has yet to discover.

207
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:43,630
最最亲爱的亚伯
My dearest Abe...

208
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:45,870
希望你能收到这张卡片
I hope this card finds you well.

209
00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:49,070
孩子们和我都非常想你
The children and I yearn to hear your news.

210
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:51,590
希望你很快能再来看望我们
I do hope you will visit us again soon.

211
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:53,550
我们都非常期待见到你
We should so love to see you.

212
00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:55,070
此致
With admiration...

213
00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:56,420
阿尔玛·佩瑞格林
Alma Peregrine.

214
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:58,910
呃…两年前寄来的
H mm. Only two years ago.

215
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:02,070
很可能她还活着
I suppose it's possible she could still be alive.

216
00:17:02,640 --> 00:17:03,780
对
Right.

217
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:06,510
我可以见见她
I could meet her.

218
00:17:06,680 --> 00:17:08,110
也许能发现
Maybe even find out what it was

219
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:09,590
爷爷想让我知道的事情
Grandpa wanted me to know.

220
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:11,070
但是如果她死了呢？
But what if she's dead?

221
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:12,240
格兰医生
Dr. Golan...

222
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:13,590
我们很关心
we are very concerned

223
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:15,470
杰克现在的心理状况
with Jake's state of mind right now.

224
00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:17,010
我没法放下工作
There's no way I'm putting my life on hold

225
00:17:17,040 --> 00:17:18,100
带你去威尔士啊
to take you to Wales.

226
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:20,910
爸爸可以带我去
Dad could take me.

227
00:17:21,080 --> 00:17:23,670
他可以去看鸟…
And he can look at birds...

228
00:17:23,840 --> 00:17:24,980
顺便完成他的书
and work on his book.

229
00:17:25,440 --> 00:17:27,670
你也能休息一段时间
It means you get a break.

230
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:29,190
就像格兰医生说的
As Dr. Golan said...

231
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:31,590
也许我就能放下了
maybe I can move on.

232
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:33,700
就像一种了结
Like, closure.

233
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:37,390
有机会去看看这个福利院
Having an opportunity to see this children's home...

234
00:17:37,560 --> 00:17:39,670
将现实和幻想分离开
and separate fantasy from reality...

235
00:17:40,280 --> 00:17:41,630
也许会有用
may be helpful.

236
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:43,150
至少
And at the very least...

237
00:17:43,320 --> 00:17:45,880
这样一次旅行能让杰克有机会
a trip like this provides a chance to...

238
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:48,190
说再见
say goodbye.

239
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:57,110
“卡瑞霍姆，人口92人
"Cairnholm. Population of 92.

240
00:17:57,680 --> 00:17:59,550
“因其最接近
"Best known for its proximity...

241
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:02,710
“奥古斯塔号邮轮最后的安息地而为人所知
"to the final resting place of the cruise liner Augusta...

242
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:05,230
“奥古斯塔号于1915年沉没
"which sank in 1915.

243
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:07,710
“岛上只有一家旅馆”
"There is just one hotel..."

244
00:18:08,360 --> 00:18:09,420
只能住那儿了
That's us.

245
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:11,470
希望那里有波本酒
Yeah. I hope there's bourbon.

246
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:17,390
杰克！快看
Jake, check it out.

247
00:18:17,560 --> 00:18:19,670
是只游隼
That's a peregrine falcon.

248
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:22,300
游隼，和那个女校长的名字一样
A peregrine, like the headmistress?

249
00:18:23,080 --> 00:18:24,390
是啊
Sure.

250
00:18:24,560 --> 00:18:26,190
说不定这就是为什么爷爷提到
That's probably where Grandpa came up

251
00:18:26,280 --> 00:18:28,030
变成鸟的事情
with that whole turning into a bird thing.

252
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:31,670
说不定那真的是她
Or maybe, maybe that's really her!

253
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:33,350
佩小姐！
Hey, Miss Peregrine.

254
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:34,910
我是杰克
It's me, Jake.

255
00:18:35,080 --> 00:18:37,270
亚伯·波特曼的孙子
I'm Abe Portman's grandson.

256
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:39,590
拜托别在我们头上拉便便
Please don't crap on us.

257
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:44,060
爸，我开玩笑呢！
Oh, my God. Dad, I'm kidding.

258
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:13,430
这…有人吗？
What the... Hello?

259
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:15,580
有人吗？
Hello?

260
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:21,790
有人在吗？
Anybody home?

261
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,000
你好
Oh, hey.

262
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:36,430
你知道这里的经理在哪儿吗？
Any idea where I'd find the manager of this place?

263
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:38,630
是我，抱歉久等了
That's me. Sorry to keep you.

264
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:40,670
刚带奥吉叔去上厕所了
Just helping Uncle Oggie to the loo.

265
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:43,830
我是凯文，楼上有房间
I'm Kev. There's room upstairs.

266
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,000
太好了
Oh, great.

267
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:46,190
我很快回来
I'll be back in a bit.

268
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:50,150
凯文去帮我们准备房间了
Kev's just getting our suite ready.

269
00:19:51,160 --> 00:19:52,510
还要等一会儿
Um, while we're waiting...

270
00:19:52,680 --> 00:19:55,270
要不咱们去海滩看看？
I thought maybe we could go check out the beach.

271
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:57,350
我还以为咱们要去儿童福利院呢
I thought we would go to the children's home.

272
00:19:57,520 --> 00:19:59,790
那些鸟是在海滩上筑巢吗？
Is the beach where the birds nest?

273
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:02,340
我们…可以很快看一眼
I thought we could just check it out real quick.

274
00:20:02,520 --> 00:20:05,110
我可以自己去福利院
I could go to the home by myself.

275
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:08,900
你就不用太匆忙了
Then, you can really take your time and enjoy it.

276
00:20:09,080 --> 00:20:11,510
别这样，小杰，你妈知道了肯定会抓狂的
Come on, Jakey. You know your mom would freak.

277
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:14,900
要不找个人带我去吧
What if we can find someone to take me?

278
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:17,860
嗨，各位
Hey, dudes.

279
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:19,910
- 爸！别！
- 别吵
- Dad. Don't.
- Shh! I got this.

280
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:21,720
你们谁
I was just wondering if any of you guys...

281
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:23,210
有兴趣带我儿子
might be interested in taking my son here

282
00:20:23,240 --> 00:20:25,310
去岛的另一边吗？
to the other side of the island.

283
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:41,470
你俩叫什么啊？
So, what are your names?

284
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:43,630
我是虫子，他是D哥
I'm Worm. This is MC Dirty D.

285
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:45,030
坏小子D哥
MC Dirty Bizniz.

286
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:46,230
我还以为你改了？
I thought you changed it.

287
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:47,320
没有
No.

288
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:48,670
你不记得了？
No, you did, remember?

289
00:20:48,840 --> 00:20:50,190
露丝说坏小子D哥
When Ruth said "MC Dirty Bizniz"

290
00:20:50,280 --> 00:20:52,000
听起来好像你裤子破了似的
made it sound like you cacked your trousers.

291
00:20:52,160 --> 00:20:54,030
对，但她说这个名字听起来
Yeah, but she said "Dirty D" sounded like

292
00:20:54,120 --> 00:20:55,180
好像个人卫生有问题
a personal hygiene problem.

293
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:57,990
听起来像是外号…
Wait. Are these, like, nicknames, or...

294
00:20:58,160 --> 00:21:00,950
是艺名，我俩是威尔士最屌的说唱歌手
Stage names. We're the sickest rappers in Wales.

295
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:03,310
快，虫子，给美国佬露两手
Go on, Worm. Show this Yank how it's done.

296
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:04,480
现在？
What? Now?

297
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:07,320
我要把教堂搅个地覆天翻
I like to get wrecked down the Priest Hole

298
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:09,240
因为你爸去教堂领救济的钱
Your dad's always here 'cause he's on the dole

299
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:11,230
我们的韵脚最屌但听起来好像不难
Our rhymes are tight Yet I make it look easy

300
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:13,470
我们的节奏最炫好像火爆的咖喱饭
Our beats are hot like chicken jalfrezi

301
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:17,510
挺好的
Oh, yeah, no. It's good.

302
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:20,230
咱们抄小道吧，D哥
Should we take the shortcut, D?

303
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:22,510
这样快一点，从这儿走
We'll get there quicker. Take it from me.

304
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:24,990
这里下去？
What, down here?

305
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:33,320
去吧
Go.

306
00:21:40,680 --> 00:21:41,870
这边？
This way?

307
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:46,520
这…
What the...

308
00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:54,150
这是去福利院的路吗？
Is this even the way to the children's home?

309
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:55,990
要穿过那片林子
Right through those trees.

310
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:27,430
鞋丢了就丢了吧，孩子
No use crying over a lost shoe, boy-o.

311
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:34,110
那个福利院…发生了什么事？
The children's home. What happened to it?

312
00:22:34,280 --> 00:22:37,980
德军空袭，炸弹正好落到福利院屋顶
A German air raid. Bomb fell right on the roof.

313
00:22:38,160 --> 00:22:41,230
1943年9月3号
September the 3rd, 1943.

314
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:43,350
那…之后那些孩子呢？
Where did they go after?

315
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:45,510
女校长和孩子们呢？
The headmistress and the children.

316
00:22:46,160 --> 00:22:49,110
无人生还，可怜的小东西们
Not one survivor. Poor little buggers.

317
00:22:50,040 --> 00:22:52,470
都还那么可爱
And they were lovely, too.

318
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:56,630
为什么爷爷不告诉我们他们都死了？
Why didn't he tell us that they all died?

319
00:22:56,800 --> 00:22:58,640
他离家去参军，三个月后
He leaves to join the army, and 3 months later,

320
00:22:58,680 --> 00:23:00,870
他认识的人都死了
everyone he knows gets killed?

321
00:23:01,800 --> 00:23:04,950
就算是爷爷也没法把这编成晚安故事啊
Not even Grandpa could turn that into a bedtime story.

322
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:08,870
也难怪他害怕做爸爸
Well, no wonder he was scared of being a dad...

323
00:23:09,040 --> 00:23:10,670
和别人亲近
being close to anyone.

324
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:13,780
听我说
Listen.

325
00:23:14,920 --> 00:23:17,110
你应该找人谈谈这件事
You need to talk about all this with someone, buddy.

326
00:23:18,120 --> 00:23:19,870
我们可以给格兰医生打电话
We should call Dr. Golan.

327
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:26,150
真是个好天气
Certainly some enjoyment today.

328
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:30,730
我可以跟
Er, do you mind if I go hang out

329
00:23:30,760 --> 00:23:32,150
其他孩子一起玩吗？
with those other kids today?

330
00:23:32,520 --> 00:23:33,520
他们叫我一起玩
They asked.

331
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:36,230
当然了，很棒啊
Yeah? That's awesome.

332
00:25:11,480 --> 00:25:12,510
亚伯？
Abe?

333
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:26,390
不！
No!

334
00:26:01,920 --> 00:26:02,920
你是艾玛
You're Emma!

335
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:05,470
还有双胞胎
And the twins.

336
00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:06,830
奥利弗
And Olive.

337
00:26:07,560 --> 00:26:08,910
布朗温
And Bronwyn.

338
00:26:09,880 --> 00:26:10,880
他是米拉德
And he's Millard.

339
00:26:12,560 --> 00:26:13,590
不对啊，你死了
No, you're dead.

340
00:26:14,120 --> 00:26:15,750
你们都死了
All of you, you're all dead.

341
00:26:15,920 --> 00:26:18,670
他虽然能隐形，但是也死了
He's invisible, but he's still dead.

342
00:26:19,080 --> 00:26:20,140
我们都没死
None of us are dead.

343
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:23,870
天呐，难道是我死了？
Oh, my God. Am I dead?

344
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:25,320
不是
No.

345
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:29,550
刚才在里面
You called me Abe.

346
00:26:30,040 --> 00:26:31,990
你为什么叫我亚伯？
In the house. Why?

347
00:26:32,160 --> 00:26:33,220
你跟他很像
You looked like him.

348
00:26:33,880 --> 00:26:34,880
一瞬间很像而已
Just for a moment,

349
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:37,030
后来你就又喊又叫
before you started screaming...

350
00:26:37,240 --> 00:26:39,070
跑掉了，还撞到了脑袋
running away, and concussing yourself.

351
00:26:39,280 --> 00:26:40,710
这是怎么回事？
Wait. What's happening?

352
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:42,330
我们在等天黑
We're waiting until the coast is clear...

353
00:26:42,360 --> 00:26:43,750
然后去圈里
before we go into the loop.

354
00:26:45,040 --> 00:26:47,670
隔墙有耳，不可不防
You never know who might be watching.

355
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:50,350
你刚说去哪里
Wait. Before we go into what?

356
00:26:50,520 --> 00:26:51,520
快走吧，杰克
Please, Jake.

357
00:26:51,680 --> 00:26:54,030
佩小姐在等你，她看见你们的船了
Miss Peregrine's waiting. She saw you on the ferry.

358
00:26:54,200 --> 00:26:55,310
她派我们来接你
She sent us to get you.

359
00:27:45,880 --> 00:27:46,880
嘿！
Hey!

360
00:27:48,120 --> 00:27:49,630
你准备去哪里啊？
Where do you think you're going?

361
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:51,830
回房间啊
To my room.

362
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:55,350
我是这里的住客
I'm a guest here.

363
00:27:55,800 --> 00:27:58,990
你看这像旅馆吗？
Does this look like a hotel to you?

364
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:02,070
对啊
Yeah.

365
00:28:02,280 --> 00:28:04,630
我有钥匙
No. I've got a key.

366
00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:07,790
你问问经理，他知道
Talk to the manager. He'll tell you.

367
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:09,700
我就是经理
I'm the manager, boy.

368
00:28:10,680 --> 00:28:12,350
他是美国人，可能是军人
He's American. Maybe he's army?

369
00:28:13,640 --> 00:28:14,670
胡说
Bollocks.

370
00:28:14,760 --> 00:28:16,590
听他的口音，真难听
Listen to his accent. It's terrible.

371
00:28:17,800 --> 00:28:19,590
他是个间谍
He's a spy.

372
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:21,910
什么？
What?

373
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,270
我不是，我是游客
No, I'm not. I'm a tourist.

374
00:28:24,440 --> 00:28:26,790
要我说，我们让他说实话
I say we should get the truth out of him

375
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:28,630
按老规矩来
the old-fashioned way.

376
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:50,790
快走！
Come on!

377
00:28:59,480 --> 00:29:00,670
杰克，快上来！
Jake, get on!

378
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:05,070
快点！
Come on! Get on, boy!

379
00:29:15,280 --> 00:29:18,070
原来你们都是真的！
I can't believe you're real. You're all real!

380
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:19,790
不是一直在告诉你嘛
We have been trying to tell you.

381
00:29:19,960 --> 00:29:21,180
但是原来我也很特殊
But I'm special, too.

382
00:29:21,320 --> 00:29:22,350
什么？
What?

383
00:29:22,440 --> 00:29:23,990
刚才在酒馆啊，奥利芙看见了
in the pub. Olive, you saw.

384
00:29:24,160 --> 00:29:27,270
那些东西飞来飞去的
Right? Everything was flying and breaking.

385
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:28,440
是我干的
And that was me!

386
00:29:28,840 --> 00:29:30,870
用意念
I was doing it with my mind.

387
00:29:31,080 --> 00:29:32,910
是我干的
No, that was me.

388
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:35,200
米拉德？
Millard?

389
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:36,900
对啊
Yeah.

390
00:29:37,960 --> 00:29:39,180
你没穿衣服？
Are you naked?

391
00:29:39,280 --> 00:29:40,310
对啊
Yeah.

392
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:43,640
哦
Oh.

393
00:29:44,920 --> 00:29:45,950
我不…
I don't...

394
00:29:46,680 --> 00:29:49,110
1943年一颗炸弹落在你们头顶
A bomb dropped on you in 1943.

395
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:51,630
现在就是1943年
It is 1943.

396
00:29:51,800 --> 00:29:54,470
1943年9月3日
September the 3rd, 1943.

397
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:56,350
每一天，这一天
All day, every day.

398
00:29:56,560 --> 00:29:57,670
就是我们的圈
It's our loop.

399
00:30:30,560 --> 00:30:31,780
分秒不差
Right on time.

400
00:30:33,040 --> 00:30:34,950
我是佩小姐，幸会幸会
Miss Peregrine. Delighted to meet you.

401
00:30:36,040 --> 00:30:37,950
希望酒馆老板不会再
I do hope I'm not going to have the pub landlord

402
00:30:38,040 --> 00:30:39,910
带着警察找上门来了
knocking on my door with the police again.

403
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:41,670
这个月已经杀过他们两次了
I've had to kill them twice this month.

404
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:43,590
太不方便了
It's been terribly inconvenient.

405
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:45,870
米拉德打破了几件东西，再没了
Millard broke a few things. That's all.

406
00:30:46,040 --> 00:30:49,550
还有奥利芙好像放了点火
And Olive may have started a tiny fire.

407
00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:53,590
但是他们要伤害杰克的
But they were going to hurt Jake.

408
00:30:57,200 --> 00:30:58,950
瞧瞧你
Look at you.

409
00:30:59,120 --> 00:31:00,920
亚伯上一次寄给我的照片上
The last time dear Abe sent me a photograph...

410
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:02,950
你还是个小宝宝呢
you were just a tiny tot.

411
00:31:03,400 --> 00:31:04,710
别站着了，快进来吧
Don't just stand there. Come in.

412
00:31:04,840 --> 00:31:06,270
茶都要凉了
Your tea's getting cold.

413
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:10,830
你怎么知道酒馆的事？
How did you know about the pub?

414
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:13,030
你体重大概109磅，对吧？
You weigh approximately 109 pounds, correct?

415
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:14,150
我不…
I don't...

416
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:16,600
你跑掉后6分钟布朗温和双胞胎就回来了
Bronwyn and the twins returned 6 minutes after you ran away.

417
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:18,030
我可能漏掉了什么
I think I'm missing something.

418
00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:19,290
你觉得酒馆是安全的
And quite apart from the fact

419
00:31:19,320 --> 00:31:20,610
所以最可能的情况就是你
that the perceived safety of the pub...

420
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:22,730
一路跑回了酒馆
makes it the most likely place to which you would flee...

421
00:31:22,760 --> 00:31:24,590
跑回酒馆要花18分钟时间
it would take you 18 minutes to run there.

422
00:31:24,760 --> 00:31:26,720
艾玛和米拉德坐马车过去
Emma and Millard would have been moments behind...

423
00:31:26,800 --> 00:31:27,860
会稍晚一点
on the horse and trap,

424
00:31:27,960 --> 00:31:29,670
他们的速度是8.2英里每小时
traveling at 8.2 miles per hour.

425
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:31,910
考虑到酒馆里发生的混乱
Factoring in some sort of kerfuffle at the pub...

426
00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:34,190
和返程中增加了你的重量
and the return journey with your added weight...

427
00:31:34,360 --> 00:31:37,310
你们会在4点过13分准时到达
you would arrive here at 13 minutes past 4.

428
00:31:38,200 --> 00:31:40,500
好了，你的茶要加糖吗？
Now, then, do you take sugar?

429
00:31:41,160 --> 00:31:42,730
可以了，谢谢你，奥利芙
That'll do. Thank you, Olive.

430
00:31:42,760 --> 00:31:45,190
茶太烫了可不好
Nobody enjoys over-boiled tea.

431
00:31:55,160 --> 00:31:57,350
我来帮你吧，伊诺克
Let me help you with those, Enoch.

432
00:31:57,560 --> 00:32:00,120
不麻烦了，我可不想搅了你们的雅兴
Don't bother. Wouldn't want to interrupt your tea party.

433
00:32:10,280 --> 00:32:12,310
节哀顺变，杰克
I'm so sorry for your loss, Jake.

434
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:16,030
看来你知道了
You know, then.

435
00:32:17,400 --> 00:32:18,910
我知道如果亚伯活着
I know if Abe were alive,

436
00:32:19,040 --> 00:32:20,670
一定会通知我们你要来
he would have told me you were coming.

437
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:26,070
我们到外面喝茶吧
Shall we take our tea outside?

438
00:32:27,280 --> 00:32:28,280
谢谢
Thank you.

439
00:32:30,680 --> 00:32:33,470
他死之前，让我找到你
Before he died, he told me to find you.

440
00:32:33,680 --> 00:32:35,310
有些事他想让我知道
There was something he wanted me to know.

441
00:32:35,480 --> 00:32:37,030
他说你会向我解释所有事
He said you could explain everything.

442
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:38,550
确实如此
That's absolutely true.

443
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:41,020
少有我解释不了的事情
There are very few things I can't explain.

444
00:32:42,160 --> 00:32:44,870
我们就是通用语中所说的
We're what's known, in common parlance,

445
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:46,710
“异能”
as "peculiar."

446
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:50,310
晚了51秒，菲奥娜
51 seconds late, Fiona.

447
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:52,020
对不起，佩小姐
Sorry, Miss Peregrine.

448
00:32:52,120 --> 00:32:53,680
晚餐需要准备多少胡萝卜？
How many carrots do you need for supper?

449
00:32:54,120 --> 00:32:56,190
一颗就够了
Just one will do.

450
00:33:10,520 --> 00:33:13,750
刚才说到，有些人拥有异能
As I was saying, some people are peculiar.

451
00:33:13,920 --> 00:33:16,910
是家族中遗传下来的隐性基因
It's a recessive gene carried down through families.

452
00:33:17,080 --> 00:33:19,070
然而，很多家庭的很多代人中
Yet, many generations can pass

453
00:33:19,160 --> 00:33:21,540
都很难出现一个异能的孩子
without a peculiar child being born.

454
00:33:22,760 --> 00:33:26,910
因此，异能人很多年来一直受到迫害
And alas, peculiars have been persecuted through the ages.

455
00:33:27,080 --> 00:33:29,190
所以我能才生活在这样的地方
Hence, we live in places like this.

456
00:33:30,200 --> 00:33:31,200
威尔士？
In Wales?

457
00:33:31,400 --> 00:33:33,350
只要选对了日子，哪里都是一样
Anywhere will do if you pick the right day.

458
00:33:33,520 --> 00:33:35,070
这就可以了，菲奥娜
That's fine now, Fiona.

459
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:42,750
我的异能是我是只回时鸟
You see, I'm a type of peculiar called an Ymbryne.

460
00:33:42,920 --> 00:33:44,270
也就是说我可以
That means I can...

461
00:33:44,440 --> 00:33:45,660
对，你可以变成鸟
Yeah, you turn into a bird.

462
00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:47,550
话是没错
I do. Yes.

463
00:33:47,720 --> 00:33:49,430
不过这没多大用处
But that's not very useful.

464
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:52,550
回时鸟的主要能力是可以操控时间
An Ymbryne's main skill is the manipulation of time.

465
00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:54,790
我们挑个安全的日子，安全的地点
We choose a safe place, a safe day...

466
00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:57,070
然后创造圈
and create a loop.

467
00:33:57,880 --> 00:33:59,270
这是什么意思？
What do you mean?

468
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:02,790
一个时间圈可以保持24小时
A loop preserves the last 24 hours.

469
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:05,630
重置时间圈，就可以重新生活这一天
Reset the loop, and the day is yours to live in again.

470
00:34:06,440 --> 00:34:07,550
每天重置
Reset it daily...

471
00:34:07,720 --> 00:34:09,630
就可以永远停留
and you can stay there forever.

472
00:34:09,800 --> 00:34:11,870
与世隔绝，保证安全
Entirely safe from the outside world.

473
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:14,550
刚刚好，布朗温，好姑娘
Right on time, Bronwyn. Good girl.

474
00:34:20,400 --> 00:34:21,950
所以总是由回时鸟
And that's why we Ymbrynes

475
00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:23,630
来照顾孩子们
are charged with the care of the young.

476
00:34:27,080 --> 00:34:29,310
没有人会老去
And no one ever gets older.

477
00:34:30,160 --> 00:34:32,070
这是最好的方法
It's best for everyone this way.

478
00:34:32,160 --> 00:34:33,470
我向你保证
I assure you.

479
00:34:37,320 --> 00:34:38,950
每一只回时鸟都会…
Every Ymbryne commits herself...

480
00:34:39,120 --> 00:34:41,270
创造和守护一个这样的地方
to the creation and upkeep of a place like this.

481
00:34:42,280 --> 00:34:44,950
这是异能孩子的家园
A home for peculiar children.

482
00:34:57,800 --> 00:34:59,270
你已经见过双胞胎了
You met the twins.

483
00:35:05,320 --> 00:35:06,510
这是克莱尔
This is Claire.

484
00:35:18,360 --> 00:35:20,030
你也见过米拉德了
Millard you met.

485
00:35:22,520 --> 00:35:23,830
那是休
And that's Hugh.

486
00:35:28,200 --> 00:35:29,870
休，不要作弊
Stop cheating, Hugh.

487
00:35:30,640 --> 00:35:32,870
米勒，你又犯规了！
Millard, that's a foul again.

488
00:35:34,200 --> 00:35:36,310
才不是！裁判？
No, it wasn't. Ref?

489
00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:38,710
如果你们玩的时候非要吵架
If you two can't play soccer without squabbling...

490
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:40,390
那就最好不要玩
I do wish you wouldn't play at all.

491
00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:41,720
你知道裁判是干什么的吗？
Do you know what a referee is?

492
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:44,630
下午好，我是霍勒斯
Good afternoon. I'm Horace.

493
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:45,800
很高兴见到你
Delighted to meet you.

494
00:35:48,360 --> 00:35:49,870
我们急需新鲜血液的注入
We sorely need some new blood here.

495
00:35:51,240 --> 00:35:52,300
衬衣不错
Super shirt, by the way.

496
00:35:53,640 --> 00:35:54,640
谢了
Thanks.

497
00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:00,910
你肯定知道艾玛
You know Emma, of course.

498
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:03,750
差不多人都认齐了
And I think that's everyone.

499
00:36:04,360 --> 00:36:06,660
布朗温是不是有个兄弟？
Didn't Bronwyn have a brother?

500
00:36:07,560 --> 00:36:09,590
对，维克多在楼上
Yes. Victor's upstairs.

501
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:11,120
等等，伊诺克和奥莉芙去哪儿了？
Wait, where did Enoch and Olive go?

502
00:36:11,880 --> 00:36:13,020
鬼知道
Heaven knows.

503
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:15,560
从我们去找杰克时，伊诺克就不见了
Enoch's been off sulking ever since we went out to get Jake.

504
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:17,170
佩小姐，有个警察在敲门
Miss Peregrine, there's a policeman at the door.

505
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:18,590
他说来处理酒馆的事
He says it's about the pub!

506
00:36:21,080 --> 00:36:22,750
我们等会再谈这事，艾玛
We'll discuss this later, Emma.

507
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:26,870
不是他们的错
It wasn't their fault.

508
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:30,270
真的，他们只是想要帮我
Honestly, they were just trying to help.

509
00:36:40,240 --> 00:36:41,430
谢谢
Thanks.

510
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:43,430
你没我想的那么傻
You're not as wet as I thought.

511
00:36:46,440 --> 00:36:50,030
她不会杀人的，对吧？
She's not really gonna kill anyone, is she?

512
00:36:50,200 --> 00:36:52,270
只要她能说服那个人
Not if she can talk her way out of it.

513
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:54,110
帮我个忙吧
Would you help me with something?

514
00:36:54,280 --> 00:36:55,950
通常都是伊诺克干的
Enoch usually does it, but like I said,

515
00:36:56,080 --> 00:36:57,390
不过他现在应该在哪儿生闷气呢
he's off sulking somewhere.

516
00:36:58,640 --> 00:37:00,190
是因为我吗？
Is that because of me?

517
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:02,960
他占有欲很强
He's possessive.

518
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:07,230
所以…你要我帮你什么？
So, what did you need help with?

519
00:37:08,040 --> 00:37:09,430
我的一项日常工作
One of my daily chores.

520
00:37:09,600 --> 00:37:11,980
把松鼠宝宝送回树上
Put the baby squirrel back in the tree.

521
00:37:12,160 --> 00:37:13,300
什么松鼠宝宝？
What baby squirrel?

522
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:20,830
每天都会发生？
That happens every day?

523
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:22,270
分秒不差
Like clockwork.

524
00:37:23,160 --> 00:37:25,200
能帮我把绳子拴在腰上吗？
Now, would you mind tying that rope around my waist?

525
00:37:56,320 --> 00:37:58,430
一定要抓紧绳子啊
Right. Promise to hold on tight.

526
00:38:43,240 --> 00:38:45,070
差点搞砸了
I nearly messed that up.

527
00:38:46,520 --> 00:38:49,030
亚伯也是…第一次的时候
Abe did, too, the first time.

528
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:50,910
这以前是他的工作
This used to be his job.

529
00:38:53,200 --> 00:38:56,590
艾玛，我得告诉你件事
Emma, I need to tell you something.

530
00:38:57,760 --> 00:38:58,900
他死了
He's dead.

531
00:39:00,560 --> 00:39:01,700
我知道
I know.

532
00:39:01,880 --> 00:39:04,440
佩小姐猜到了，她总是对的
Miss Peregrine guessed, and she's always right.

533
00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:06,920
没事的
It's okay.

534
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:09,910
我很久以前就和他说过再见了
I said goodbye to him a long time ago.

535
00:39:10,680 --> 00:39:12,190
你们很亲近是吗？
Were you close?

536
00:39:14,600 --> 00:39:16,230
我以为是
I thought we were.

537
00:39:17,240 --> 00:39:18,950
一度
For a while.

538
00:39:19,120 --> 00:39:20,750
但我觉得应该不是
But I suppose not.

539
00:39:23,120 --> 00:39:25,910
容我问一句，他喜欢你，对吧？
Can I ask, was he like you?

540
00:39:29,080 --> 00:39:30,710
他很像你，杰克
He was like you, Jake.

541
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:34,830
我要去换件衣服，准备吃晚餐了
I need to go and change for supper.

542
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:36,630
你会和我们一起用餐吗？
Will you be dining with us?

543
00:39:37,080 --> 00:39:38,950
我不能在外面待太晚
I can't stay out late.

544
00:39:39,120 --> 00:39:40,750
晚餐五点半开始
Supper's at 5:30.

545
00:39:41,960 --> 00:39:44,110
那…挺早的
Uh... That is pretty early.

546
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:46,390
幸好我们不都是八岁的孩子
The fact we're not all eight years old

547
00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:48,110
给佩小姐减少了不少负担
seems to have eluded Miss Peregrine.

548
00:39:49,240 --> 00:39:51,110
你可以借件亚伯的衣服穿
You can borrow some of Abe's clothes.

549
00:39:51,320 --> 00:39:53,310
他的房间在阁楼
His room's in the attic.

550
00:40:03,640 --> 00:40:04,640
杰克
Jake!

551
00:40:05,160 --> 00:40:06,550
来认识认识伊诺克
Come and meet Enoch properly.

552
00:40:17,640 --> 00:40:19,830
你应该不太适应这里的环境
You must feel pretty out of place.

553
00:40:21,680 --> 00:40:22,950
不用担心
Don't worry.

554
00:40:23,520 --> 00:40:25,270
我习惯了
I'm used to it.

555
00:40:25,480 --> 00:40:26,620
我不担心
No. I wasn't worried.

556
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:29,510
但还是给你一些忠告，开诚布公的讲
Some advice for you though, man to man.

557
00:40:29,680 --> 00:40:32,000
如果你只是因为喜欢艾玛才待在这里
If you're thinking of staying just because you like Emma...

558
00:40:32,360 --> 00:40:33,360
就不必了
don't bother.

559
00:40:33,520 --> 00:40:35,820
她心碎以后
You see, she swore off romance decades ago...

560
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:37,310
已经多年不沾情爱了
when she got her heart broken.

561
00:40:38,200 --> 00:40:41,030
她也不会改变想法的
And she's never gonna change her mind. So...

562
00:40:44,320 --> 00:40:45,950
伊诺克，我不是…
Enoch, I wasn't...

563
00:40:47,880 --> 00:40:48,880
你在干什么？
What are you doing?

564
00:41:19,680 --> 00:41:20,790
是不是很棒？
Isn't he amazing?

565
00:41:21,320 --> 00:41:22,380
你刚才做的是什么？
What did you do?

566
00:41:23,080 --> 00:41:24,470
这个？
This?

567
00:41:24,880 --> 00:41:27,150
杰克，这还不是最有趣的
Jake, this isn't even the fun part.

568
00:41:27,680 --> 00:41:28,920
你想看最有趣的吗？
Do you want to see the fun part?

569
00:41:53,840 --> 00:41:54,980
它们就像傀儡
They're like puppets.

570
00:41:55,200 --> 00:41:57,580
听我的命令
Just do anything I tell them.

571
00:41:59,840 --> 00:42:01,590
如果是人的话就更有趣了
It's even more fun with people.

572
00:42:01,760 --> 00:42:02,880
你该看看我以前参与的
You should have seen some of

573
00:42:02,920 --> 00:42:04,390
史诗级的战争
the epic battles they used to have...

574
00:42:04,560 --> 00:42:05,870
发生在我父母的葬礼上
at my parents' funeral parlor.

575
00:42:09,240 --> 00:42:10,430
你还需要领结
You'll need a necktie.

576
00:42:19,720 --> 00:42:22,630
我祖父在旅行期间，做了什么？
So what did my grandpa do when he was traveling?

577
00:42:23,400 --> 00:42:25,190
参观其他的时间圈
Visited other loops.

578
00:42:25,800 --> 00:42:28,230
是吗？做什么？
Really? To do what?

579
00:42:29,120 --> 00:42:30,630
杰克，有些问题
Jake, there's some questions

580
00:42:30,720 --> 00:42:32,710
我不能回答你的，好吗？
that I can't answer, all right?

581
00:42:32,880 --> 00:42:34,910
所以你最好还是
So, it would be a lot easier for me if you just...

582
00:42:35,800 --> 00:42:37,110
不要问了
stopped asking them.

583
00:42:56,960 --> 00:42:58,050
你在干什么？
Hey! What are you doing?

584
00:42:58,080 --> 00:42:59,080
米拉德
Millard.

585
00:42:59,240 --> 00:43:01,070
去穿件衣服
Go and put some clothes on.

586
00:43:01,240 --> 00:43:03,310
懂礼貌的人不会吃晚餐的时候不穿衣服
Polite persons do not take their supper in the nude.

587
00:43:03,480 --> 00:43:05,510
好吧！
All right. All right.

588
00:43:08,680 --> 00:43:10,590
杰克你可以坐这里
You can sit here, Jake.

589
00:43:12,840 --> 00:43:13,840
瞧瞧伊诺克
Look at Enoch.

590
00:43:14,600 --> 00:43:15,660
他又嫉妒了
He's jealous.

591
00:43:16,120 --> 00:43:17,830
我嫉妒什么？
Why would I be jealous?

592
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:19,950
你们想结婚就结好了，与我无关
Olive can go marry Jake, for all I care.

593
00:43:20,120 --> 00:43:22,500
伊诺克，别这样，她没这样想
Don't be mean, Enoch. She doesn't want to.

594
00:43:22,680 --> 00:43:24,590
她只是因为有访客而激动罢了
She's just excited to have a visitor.

595
00:43:24,760 --> 00:43:26,510
没人要结婚
Nobody is marrying anybody.

596
00:43:26,680 --> 00:43:28,430
现在大家快吃饭，别等菜凉了
Now, eat up your food before it gets cold.

597
00:43:33,320 --> 00:43:34,350
休
Hugh!

598
00:43:35,520 --> 00:43:37,310
你的网罩呢？
Where's your net?

599
00:43:37,840 --> 00:43:40,030
休，别这样！
Hugh! You have to stop doing this, Hugh.

600
00:43:50,720 --> 00:43:52,630
杰克，你一定觉得十分诡异吧
Must be very strange for you, Jake.

601
00:43:53,040 --> 00:43:54,950
见到了你祖父的朋友
Meeting your grandfather's friends.

602
00:43:55,120 --> 00:43:56,710
来到另一个世纪
Visiting another century.

603
00:43:56,880 --> 00:43:58,720
你生活的时代有宇宙飞船吗？
Are there spaceships in your time, Jake?

604
00:43:58,880 --> 00:44:00,310
像飞侠哥顿里的一样
Like the Flash Gordon books.

605
00:44:00,560 --> 00:44:01,560
好了！奥莉芙
Now, now, Olive.

606
00:44:01,720 --> 00:44:03,390
我以前说过什么
What did I say about asking questions?

607
00:44:04,240 --> 00:44:05,710
我们不讨论将来
We don't discuss the future here.

608
00:44:05,880 --> 00:44:08,390
只活在当下，享受一切
We enjoy living in the good old here and now.

609
00:44:11,680 --> 00:44:12,880
克莱尔，你怎么不吃?
Claire, why aren't you eating?

610
00:44:14,320 --> 00:44:15,990
在杰克面前，她不太好意思
She's embarrassed in front of Jake.

611
00:44:16,160 --> 00:44:17,710
没关系的
Don't be. Please.

612
00:44:35,600 --> 00:44:37,830
杰克，你的异能是什么？
So, Jake, what's your peculiarity?

613
00:44:38,760 --> 00:44:40,590
我…我没有异能
Oh, I'm not peculiar.

614
00:44:40,760 --> 00:44:41,900
看到了吧
And that, my friends,

615
00:44:42,040 --> 00:44:43,830
这就是他为什么不能和我们待在一起
is why he will not be staying with us...

616
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:46,430
不管我们怎么劝他
no matter how hard we try to persuade him.

617
00:44:46,600 --> 00:44:49,190
我们已经说过这件事了，杰克只是来做客的
We've spoken about this. Jake is just visiting.

618
00:44:49,360 --> 00:44:50,580
他也许想留下呢
He might want to stay.

619
00:44:50,760 --> 00:44:52,510
你想待在这里吗，杰克？
Don't you want to stay, Jake?

620
00:44:52,960 --> 00:44:54,390
今晚还是…
Tonight? Or...

621
00:44:54,560 --> 00:44:56,670
永远，你应该永远留在这里
Forever. You should stay forever.

622
00:44:56,880 --> 00:44:59,180
没必要的话为什么要留下来？
Why would he, if he doesn't have to?

623
00:44:59,360 --> 00:45:01,390
他可以在外面生活，慢慢变老
He can live out there, grow older...

624
00:45:01,560 --> 00:45:03,070
享受时光
have a good time instead.

625
00:45:03,240 --> 00:45:05,800
然后像他祖父那样，离开人世
He'll leave, just like his grandfather did.

626
00:45:11,120 --> 00:45:12,120
艾玛！
Emma!

627
00:45:12,280 --> 00:45:13,470
抱歉
Excuse me.

628
00:45:13,640 --> 00:45:14,640
她去哪里？
Where's she going?

629
00:45:14,800 --> 00:45:15,940
伊诺克，这样很不好！
That wasn't nice, Enoch.

630
00:45:16,080 --> 00:45:18,640
你明明知道亚伯离开我们
You know perfectly well why Abe left us.

631
00:45:18,800 --> 00:45:19,800
是为了去参军
To join the army.

632
00:45:19,960 --> 00:45:22,470
接着他遇到了一个姑娘，然后结了婚
And then he met a lady, and had a nice wedding cake...

633
00:45:22,640 --> 00:45:24,310
还有个可爱的小宝宝
and a lovely little baby.

634
00:45:24,400 --> 00:45:25,400
孩子们！
Children.

635
00:45:27,320 --> 00:45:29,620
我知道你们都想认识新朋友
I know you'd all like a new friend...

636
00:45:29,800 --> 00:45:33,150
但杰克在佛罗里达还有很多自己的事
but I'm sure Jake has plenty of his own back in Florida.

637
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:37,910
我希望在我接完电话后
I think you should all get ready

638
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:40,380
你们可以准备好去看电影了
for movie time while I answer that.

639
00:45:40,560 --> 00:45:42,550
可是你总是让我们待在那里
But you always let us stay for it.

640
00:46:01,640 --> 00:46:03,110
嗨，我是亚伯
Hello, this is Abe.

641
00:46:03,800 --> 00:46:05,470
大家都还好吗？
How is everyone?

642
00:46:12,360 --> 00:46:14,080
杰克，你的我多加了棉花糖糖
Yours has extra marshmallows, Jake.

643
00:46:14,160 --> 00:46:16,430
米拉德，把睡衣穿上
Millard, put some pajamas on.

644
00:46:16,600 --> 00:46:17,950
这里好热
It's too hot in here.

645
00:46:18,120 --> 00:46:19,310
不要抱怨了
Stop moaning.

646
00:46:19,480 --> 00:46:20,560
抱歉
Excuse me.

647
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:31,350
我祖父给我讲过
My grandpa told me about this.

648
00:46:31,520 --> 00:46:33,870
霍勒斯能把他做的梦投放出来，是吗？
Horace projects his dreams, right?

649
00:46:34,040 --> 00:46:35,470
他过去常听收音机
He used to listen to the radio.

650
00:46:35,640 --> 00:46:38,350
极其乏味，我已经倒背如流了
Gets tedious when you know every word off by heart.

651
00:46:42,480 --> 00:46:44,190
很好，这件我要了
Splendid. I'll take it.

652
00:46:44,400 --> 00:46:45,870
很多都是关于服装的
He dreams about clothes mostly.

653
00:46:46,040 --> 00:46:47,230
很高兴见到你
Delighted to meet you.

654
00:46:48,880 --> 00:46:50,830
衬衫不错
Super shirt, by the way.

655
00:46:53,400 --> 00:46:55,230
他什么时候梦到这个的？
When did he dream this?

656
00:46:55,400 --> 00:46:56,670
昨晚
Last night.

657
00:46:56,840 --> 00:46:58,390
有些梦有预见性
Some of his dreams are prophetic.

658
00:46:58,560 --> 00:47:00,790
但绝大多数还是关于服装的
But, mostly they're about clothes.

659
00:47:02,080 --> 00:47:05,230
预见性是说，他能预见未来？
Prophetic as in, he can see into the future?

660
00:47:19,760 --> 00:47:21,430
回时鸟，她是谁？
An Ymbryne. Who is she?

661
00:47:21,600 --> 00:47:23,230
佩小姐，你认识她吗？
Miss Peregrine, do you know her?

662
00:47:23,440 --> 00:47:24,440
傻瓜
Don't be silly.

663
00:47:24,600 --> 00:47:26,750
霍勒斯只是做了个噩梦而已
Horace must have just had a bad dream. That's all.

664
00:48:01,480 --> 00:48:03,320
足够了，谢谢你，霍勒斯
That's quite enough of that. Thank you, Horace.

665
00:48:03,920 --> 00:48:05,590
我想我该走了
I should probably get going.

666
00:48:06,480 --> 00:48:08,860
你可以在这待一晚上，你愿意的话
You could stay the night, if you wanted to.

667
00:48:09,040 --> 00:48:10,950
这样就不要晚上走回去了
Rather than walk home alone in the dark.

668
00:48:11,120 --> 00:48:14,310
这座岛不是挺安全的吗？
But the island is very safe, isn't it?

669
00:48:14,480 --> 00:48:15,700
当然
Of course!

670
00:48:15,880 --> 00:48:18,470
我是说这里的路特别难走
I only meant the path is dreadfully bumpy.

671
00:48:18,640 --> 00:48:19,780
杰克可能会跌倒
Jake could trip.

672
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:21,710
或许你可以带他走近路？
Perhaps you could show him the shortcuts.

673
00:48:21,880 --> 00:48:24,750
这样他就不会跌倒了
Should he ever need to avoid bumps.

674
00:48:25,160 --> 00:48:26,890
不留下来看看如何开始新的一天吗？
Won't you at least stay to see the reset, Jake?

675
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:29,130
超震撼的
It's really quite spectacular.

676
00:48:29,160 --> 00:48:30,950
留下来吧，杰克！
Yeah! Stay, Jake!

677
00:51:12,840 --> 00:51:13,980
什么声音？
What was that?

678
00:51:14,160 --> 00:51:15,830
我的手机
It was my phone.

679
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:18,750
可能是在时间圈里，一直都没信号
It's been dead the whole time in the loop. I guess now...

680
00:51:18,920 --> 00:51:20,230
你的手机？
Your phone?

681
00:51:20,920 --> 00:51:23,480
对，就像电话
Yeah. Like a telephone.

682
00:51:23,680 --> 00:51:25,980
可以打电话
You can call people...

683
00:51:26,160 --> 00:51:28,150
可以发短信
send written messages.

684
00:51:28,320 --> 00:51:30,150
对了，你会喜欢这个的
Wait, you'll love this.

685
00:51:30,320 --> 00:51:31,910
你可以拍照
You can take a picture.

686
00:51:32,080 --> 00:51:34,350
按那里…那…对
Press that, there. Yeah.

687
00:51:35,920 --> 00:51:36,980
看见了没？
See?

688
00:51:44,160 --> 00:51:45,630
怎么了？
What's wrong?

689
00:51:48,280 --> 00:51:51,670
想到有一天你会长大
It's just funny to think that one day, you'll grow up.

690
00:51:51,840 --> 00:51:53,030
就像亚伯
Like Abe did.

691
00:51:53,760 --> 00:51:56,350
结婚生子
Get married, have children.

692
00:51:56,520 --> 00:51:57,660
孙子孙女
Grandchildren.

693
00:51:58,440 --> 00:52:00,590
你也许还会给他们看这张照片
You might even show them this photograph.

694
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:03,470
而我还在这里
And I'll still be here.

695
00:52:05,400 --> 00:52:07,590
你能离开这里吗？
Couldn't you leave some day?

696
00:52:07,760 --> 00:52:10,510
如果你想的话，能生活在现实世界吗？
And live in the present, if you wanted to?

697
00:52:10,680 --> 00:52:11,680
不行
No.

698
00:52:12,120 --> 00:52:13,490
在那里待几分钟
More than a few minutes in your time

699
00:52:13,520 --> 00:52:15,150
时间就会赶上来
and the years would catch up.

700
00:52:16,600 --> 00:52:18,070
你会变老？
You would age?

701
00:52:26,680 --> 00:52:28,750
这个好像是霍勒斯梦中的回时鸟
I think it's the Ymbryne from Horace's dream.

702
00:52:29,240 --> 00:52:31,990
你确定它不是一只普通的鸟吗？
Are you sure it's not just a bird?

703
00:52:32,240 --> 00:52:33,670
我不知道，它难道不会变身吗？
I don't know, wouldn't it change?

704
00:52:33,840 --> 00:52:36,070
不能，她受伤了
She can't. Not if she's hurt.

705
00:52:37,080 --> 00:52:39,750
我要把她带进去，你该走了
I need to take her inside. You should go.

706
00:52:43,240 --> 00:52:44,670
请不要说话了
Please don't say anything else.

707
00:52:44,760 --> 00:52:46,310
我讨厌说再见
I hate goodbyes.

708
00:52:49,240 --> 00:52:50,240
我明天再来
I'll come back tomorrow.

709
00:52:51,520 --> 00:52:54,830
不用着急，我永远都在这里
There's no hurry. I'll be here forever.

710
00:53:02,440 --> 00:53:03,440
嘿！
Hey!

711
00:53:05,560 --> 00:53:06,730
我在这个破岛上转了一整天了
I've been all over this damn island.

712
00:53:06,760 --> 00:53:07,870
你去哪儿了？
Where the hell were you?

713
00:53:08,080 --> 00:53:10,110
我正好往回走
Um, I was just on my way back.

714
00:53:10,280 --> 00:53:11,910
对不起，我忘了看时间了
I'm sorry. I lost track of time.

715
00:53:12,960 --> 00:53:15,420
我和虫子，还有D哥玩儿了一天
I was having a blast with Worm and Dirty D.

716
00:53:16,360 --> 00:53:17,420
D哥？
Dirty D?

717
00:53:18,520 --> 00:53:19,710
你知道吗？
You know what?

718
00:53:19,920 --> 00:53:22,070
我觉得这样挺好，很健康
This is good. This is healthy.

719
00:53:22,240 --> 00:53:23,910
你认识了古怪的朋友
You're making weird friends...

720
00:53:24,960 --> 00:53:26,950
跟其他年轻人们一样
and doing teenage stuff.

721
00:53:27,120 --> 00:53:28,120
我觉得这挺好的
I think this is normal.

722
00:53:28,240 --> 00:53:29,710
格兰医生肯定会同意这么做的
I'm sure Doctor Golan will approve.

723
00:53:29,880 --> 00:53:31,590
嘿，那个美国佬
Hey, you. American!

724
00:53:31,760 --> 00:53:32,950
到这儿来
Get over here.

725
00:53:34,880 --> 00:53:35,940
哦，他们俩在那儿
Oh, look. There they are.

726
00:53:36,120 --> 00:53:39,310
D哥和虫子
There's D-Bag and Worm Man.

727
00:53:39,480 --> 00:53:40,590
是你干的吗？
Did you do this?

728
00:53:42,080 --> 00:53:44,310
什么？不是！
What? No.

729
00:53:44,920 --> 00:53:45,950
当然不是
Of course not.

730
00:53:46,480 --> 00:53:47,590
肯定不是我们
It wasn't us.

731
00:53:48,240 --> 00:53:49,930
这位先生，我不知道这里发生了什么
Listen, sir. I don't know what happened here.

732
00:53:49,960 --> 00:53:52,990
但是我儿子一直和他朋友在一起
But my son and his friends have been together all day.

733
00:53:53,160 --> 00:53:55,430
杰克肯定不会干这种事儿的
Jake would never do anything like this.

734
00:53:55,600 --> 00:53:57,110
胡说！我们今天就没见过他！
Bollocks! We haven't seen him!

735
00:53:57,280 --> 00:53:58,390
你昨天付了我们钱
You paid us yesterday.

736
00:53:58,480 --> 00:54:00,310
我们今天为什么要免费陪他玩儿？
Why would we hang out with him today for free?

737
00:54:03,160 --> 00:54:06,150
杰克，你今天有没有和他们在一起？
Jake? Were you with them or not?

738
00:54:07,520 --> 00:54:09,630
没有！对不起！
No. I'm sorry.

739
00:54:10,640 --> 00:54:12,470
你不是真的觉得这是我做的吧？
But you don't seriously think I could do this?

740
00:54:13,720 --> 00:54:15,310
我想我们已经都弄清楚了
I think we're done here, sir.

741
00:54:16,840 --> 00:54:18,990
能帮我留个言吗？
Can you pass on a message for me?

742
00:54:19,160 --> 00:54:21,150
你就告诉格兰医生
Can you tell Doctor Golan...

743
00:54:21,360 --> 00:54:23,710
要不是她怂恿进行这次荒谬的旅行
that if she hadn't encouraged this cockamamie trip...

744
00:54:23,880 --> 00:54:25,020
我儿子也不会
maybe my son wouldn't be

745
00:54:25,160 --> 00:54:26,850
跑到一个废弃的房子里面呆了一整天
moping around all day in a derelict house...

746
00:54:26,880 --> 00:54:28,710
以至于都神情恍惚了！
having a goddamn breakdown!

747
00:54:29,680 --> 00:54:30,820
喂？
Hello?

748
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:32,510
爸，我没有
Dad, I'm not.

749
00:54:33,320 --> 00:54:34,320
我没事儿
I'm fine.

750
00:54:34,480 --> 00:54:36,190
你不好
No. You're not.

751
00:54:37,320 --> 00:54:39,310
你有事儿，杰克
You're not fine, Jake.

752
00:54:40,360 --> 00:54:42,990
到这儿来就是个彻头彻尾的错误
Coming here was a terrible, terrible idea.

753
00:54:43,680 --> 00:54:45,630
对不起，我说谎了
Look, I'm sorry I lied. I just wanted...

754
00:54:45,840 --> 00:54:48,300
闹钟定在早上8点
Just set your alarm for 8:00 a.m.

755
00:54:48,760 --> 00:54:50,710
我想早点儿去海滩上看看
I wanna get to the beach early.

756
00:54:50,880 --> 00:54:51,970
剩下这几天
The rest of the time we're stuck

757
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:53,140
在这个破岛上
on this craphole island...

758
00:54:53,320 --> 00:54:54,710
我们俩必须一起行动
we're sticking together.

759
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:57,030
你去哪儿？
Where are you going?

760
00:54:57,200 --> 00:54:59,230
去楼下喝一杯
Downstairs for a drink.

761
00:55:48,120 --> 00:55:49,200
亲爱的佩小姐
Dear Miss Peregrine...

762
00:55:49,720 --> 00:55:51,390
我不想让你们担心
I don't wish to alarm you...

763
00:55:51,560 --> 00:55:54,120
但是我的一个线人告诉我
but one of my informants sent me this.

764
00:55:54,880 --> 00:55:57,390
巴伦先生的一些同伙
It would appear that some of Mr. Barron's group...

765
00:55:57,560 --> 00:55:59,390
出现在英格兰黑谭镇附近
are in Blackpool, England.

766
00:56:00,600 --> 00:56:01,950
如果我没记错
If I recall...

767
00:56:02,120 --> 00:56:04,420
艾娃塞小姐在那儿有一个时间圈
Miss Avocet has a loop there.

768
00:56:05,080 --> 00:56:06,990
请给她发出预警
Please warn her and suggest...

769
00:56:07,160 --> 00:56:08,990
让她尽快建立一个新的时空循环
that she make a new one right away...

770
00:56:09,160 --> 00:56:10,270
隐匿好行踪
well-hidden.

771
00:56:10,440 --> 00:56:13,000
请珍重
And take the greatest care yourself.

772
00:56:13,160 --> 00:56:14,910
祝好，亚伯
With love, Abe.

773
00:56:15,080 --> 00:56:17,070
2016年1月
January, 2016.

774
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:37,510
准备好去海滩了吗？
Who's ready to hit the beach?

775
00:56:44,200 --> 00:56:45,670
我去…
Oh, my...

776
00:56:46,360 --> 00:56:47,360
难以置信！
Unbelievable.

777
00:56:49,160 --> 00:56:51,030
在鸟巢区域架设备？
Right in the middle of a nesting area?

778
00:56:51,200 --> 00:56:53,470
哪儿来的外行居然这么干？
What kind of idiot does that?

779
00:56:54,840 --> 00:56:57,670
事实上，主要筑巢区在那边
Actually, the main nesting area is over there.

780
00:56:58,280 --> 00:56:59,830
你想看看吗，我可以领你过去
I can show you if you'd like.

781
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:02,190
很高兴能在此遇到一个同样喜欢拍摄鸟类的人
It's marvelous to meet a fellow bird spotter.

782
00:57:02,320 --> 00:57:03,350
约翰·拉蒙特
John Lamont.

783
00:57:03,560 --> 00:57:05,630
富兰克林·波特曼，这是我儿子，杰克
Franklin Portman. This is my son, Jake.

784
00:57:06,360 --> 00:57:07,500
约翰·拉蒙特
John Lamont.

785
00:57:07,680 --> 00:57:09,240
你居然带着这么棒的相机来这儿
That's a hell of a camera you got there.

786
00:57:10,040 --> 00:57:12,670
谢谢，这地方真是太赞了
Oh, thanks. It's absolutely fantastic.

787
00:57:12,840 --> 00:57:16,190
我是来给我的书拍一些插图的
I'm here to do some snaps for a book I'm writing.

788
00:57:16,360 --> 00:57:18,190
你们二位是过来度假的吗？
So, you gentlemen here on holiday?

789
00:57:21,640 --> 00:57:24,150
不幸的是，她的翅膀
Unfortunately, her wings were flapping

790
00:57:24,240 --> 00:57:25,270
呼哒的就像一只鸟！
as much as the bird's!

791
00:57:27,480 --> 00:57:28,560
我觉得你们
I think you fellas are

792
00:57:28,640 --> 00:57:29,850
现在想的是另一种鸟
thinking of another kind of bird.

793
00:57:29,880 --> 00:57:31,440
你今天不再去海滩照相了吗？
So, you're not going to the beach today?

794
00:57:32,040 --> 00:57:33,350
有什么意义呢？
What's the point?

795
00:57:33,520 --> 00:57:35,110
如果那个家伙举着相机
If that guy is gonna cover Cairnholm

796
00:57:35,200 --> 00:57:36,670
把整个岛的照片都发表在他那个包装精美的书里
in some big, glossy book...

797
00:57:36,840 --> 00:57:38,470
谁还会看我拍的照片
no one's gonna even wanna look at mine.

798
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:41,910
我去睡个午觉
Might just have a nice afternoon nap.

799
00:57:42,760 --> 00:57:44,270
你俩今早在哪里
I don't suppose you saw Uncle Oggie

800
00:57:44,360 --> 00:57:46,190
看见老欧吉了吗？
on your travels this morning, did you?

801
00:57:46,400 --> 00:57:47,910
按说他现在应该过来了
He's usually here by now.

802
00:57:48,080 --> 00:57:49,190
我可以帮忙去找找他
I could go look for him.

803
00:57:49,920 --> 00:57:51,390
你哪儿也别想去
You're not going anywhere.

804
00:58:27,080 --> 00:58:29,430
杰克，你回来了！快来和我们一起玩儿！
Jake, you're back! Come and play!

805
00:58:34,120 --> 00:58:36,070
我想要先见见佩小姐
I need to see Miss Peregrine first.

806
00:58:36,240 --> 00:58:37,590
你知道她在哪儿吗？
Do you know where she is?

807
00:58:42,920 --> 00:58:45,550
杰克，你回来了，太好了！
Jake. You're back. How wonderful!

808
00:58:46,280 --> 00:58:47,280
它怎么样了？
How's it doing?

809
00:58:47,920 --> 00:58:49,230
艾玛说这是一只回时鸟
Emma said it was an Ymbryne.

810
00:58:49,800 --> 00:58:51,230
她，不是“它”
"She." Not "it."

811
00:58:51,400 --> 00:58:53,270
回时鸟都是女性
Ymbrynes are always female.

812
00:58:53,440 --> 00:58:54,830
艾玛说的非常正确
And Emma was quite correct.

813
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:56,590
这位是艾娃塞小姐
This is Miss Avocet.

814
00:58:56,800 --> 00:58:59,550
她的时间圈在英格兰黑谭镇
Her loop's in Blackpool. England.

815
00:59:02,280 --> 00:59:04,430
这是私人信件，杰克
That was a private letter, Jake.

816
00:59:07,160 --> 00:59:08,630
谁是巴伦先生？
Who is Mr. Barron?

817
00:59:11,640 --> 00:59:13,070
佩小姐，如果我爷爷
Miss Peregrine, if my Grandpa

818
00:59:13,160 --> 00:59:15,110
和什么危险的人物有瓜葛
was involved with dangerous people...

819
00:59:15,320 --> 00:59:16,830
我有必要将这些都告诉给警察
I need to tell the police.

820
00:59:18,120 --> 00:59:19,120
告诉警察？
Police?

821
00:59:20,320 --> 00:59:22,670
你这是在暗示亚伯是非正常死亡吗？
Are you implying Abe died an unnatural death?

822
00:59:23,200 --> 00:59:24,790
我在树林里找到他时
I found him in the woods...

823
00:59:24,960 --> 00:59:26,990
他的眼睛不见了
with his eyes missing.

824
00:59:27,160 --> 00:59:28,990
我觉得这很不正常
I'd say that was pretty unnatural.

825
00:59:33,640 --> 00:59:36,830
除非必要，我不想讨论这些让人不愉快的事儿
Unless essential, I don't discuss unpleasant matters.

826
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:39,460
回时鸟的职责是保护孩子，杰克
An Ymbryne's duty is to protect children, Jake.

827
00:59:40,680 --> 00:59:42,270
我不是小孩儿了
I'm not a child.

828
00:59:43,320 --> 00:59:45,880
爷爷他想让你把这些都告诉我
He wanted you to tell me everything!

829
00:59:50,880 --> 00:59:52,830
哦，真郁闷啊
Oh. How frustrating for you.

830
00:59:53,360 --> 00:59:54,710
鉴于佩小姐的规定
Between Miss Peregrine's rules...

831
00:59:54,880 --> 00:59:57,000
以及我那条不想吓坏你的室友守则
and my housemates' little pact not to scare you off...

832
00:59:57,040 --> 00:59:59,150
所以，没有人会给你答案的
it's like no one's telling you anything!

833
01:00:00,520 --> 01:00:02,310
要不你来告诉我？
Why don't you, then?

834
01:00:02,400 --> 01:00:03,830
反正你也不想我留在这儿
It's not like you want me here.

835
01:00:04,360 --> 01:00:06,820
伊诺克，你不能告诉他，你保证过不说的
Enoch, you can't. You promised.

836
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:09,190
奥利芙说得对
Olive's right.

837
01:00:10,040 --> 01:00:11,330
但是我知道有一个人
I do know someone who can get away

838
01:00:11,360 --> 01:00:12,710
可以不用遵守这项规定
with breaking rules though.

839
01:00:13,360 --> 01:00:14,630
你想去见见他吗？
Want to meet him?

840
01:00:16,080 --> 01:00:18,640
伊诺克，别这么做，求你了！
Enoch, don't do this. Please!

841
01:00:18,840 --> 01:00:20,170
是你想大家一起玩的
You want to spend time with me and Jake,

842
01:00:20,200 --> 01:00:21,340
我们可以一起玩
we can all play together.

843
01:00:21,520 --> 01:00:22,830
自己说的话不记得了？
That's what you said.

844
01:00:24,200 --> 01:00:25,910
就是这儿了
Here we all are.

845
01:00:27,200 --> 01:00:28,870
让开，奥利芙
Move, Olive.

846
01:00:29,040 --> 01:00:30,280
你要是非这么做
If you're going to be like that,

847
01:00:30,360 --> 01:00:32,660
我以后就不跟你做朋友了
then I don't want to be your friend.

848
01:00:35,440 --> 01:00:39,390
伊诺克！别打扰维克多，布朗温会不高兴的
Enoch, leave Victor alone. It really upsets Bronwyn.

849
01:00:39,560 --> 01:00:41,350
别闹了，菲奥娜
Stop fussing, Fiona.

850
01:00:41,440 --> 01:00:43,120
你不觉得杰克应该和这里的每个人都认识一下吗？
Don't you think Jake should meet everybody?

851
01:00:43,240 --> 01:00:44,760
他想把你吓跑，杰克
He's trying to frighten you away, Jake.

852
01:00:44,880 --> 01:00:47,670
他一直都嫉妒艾伯，现在他又开始嫉妒你
He was always jealous of Abe. And now he's jealous of you.

853
01:00:47,840 --> 01:00:49,230
还是过来跟我们一起玩儿吧
Come and play with us instead.

854
01:00:53,440 --> 01:00:56,270
我想我应该去见见维克多
I'd quite like to meet Victor.

855
01:01:02,880 --> 01:01:04,070
你先请
After you.

856
01:01:12,600 --> 01:01:13,630
你好维克多
Hello, Victor.

857
01:01:14,760 --> 01:01:17,870
我是杰克，不好意思打扰你
I'm Jake. I'm sorry to disturb...

858
01:01:21,560 --> 01:01:22,780
他听不见你说话
Yeah, he can't hear you.

859
01:01:48,280 --> 01:01:50,150
你好杰克，我叫维克多
Hello, Jake. I'm Victor.

860
01:01:50,280 --> 01:01:51,670
你想知道是什么杀害了我吗？
Do you want to know what killed me?

861
01:01:59,640 --> 01:02:01,470
你在这儿呢，他没和你一起吗？
There you are. Is Enoch with you?

862
01:02:01,600 --> 01:02:03,070
到了每天散步的时间了
It's time for our daily walk.

863
01:02:06,080 --> 01:02:08,460
艾玛，是谁害了维克多？
Emma, who killed Victor?

864
01:02:08,640 --> 01:02:10,310
是那些白色眼睛的人吗？
Was it the people with the white eyes?

865
01:02:10,480 --> 01:02:12,110
我跟你说了别问这么多
I asked you not to ask questions.

866
01:02:12,280 --> 01:02:15,270
我爷爷去世的那晚我见过一个
I saw one the night my grandpa died.

867
01:02:15,440 --> 01:02:16,470
这样的人
A man.

868
01:02:18,440 --> 01:02:19,470
如果你的确见过这么一个
If it really was one,

869
01:02:19,600 --> 01:02:21,190
你应该告诉佩小姐
you have to tell Miss Peregrine.

870
01:02:21,360 --> 01:02:23,470
你能从照片里认出这个人吗？
Could you recognize him from a photograph?

871
01:02:23,640 --> 01:02:25,030
你有照片吗？
Do you have one?

872
01:02:26,360 --> 01:02:28,310
那就跟我走，跟我去个地儿
Come on. There's somewhere I go to be alone.

873
01:02:28,440 --> 01:02:29,870
我在那儿存了些东西
I have things there.

874
01:03:07,240 --> 01:03:08,510
是这儿吗？
Is this the place?

875
01:03:08,720 --> 01:03:10,870
不是，这只是我们去哪儿的途径
No. This is how we get there.

876
01:03:30,400 --> 01:03:32,230
艾玛！你的鞋！
Oh! Emma! Your shoes!

877
01:03:32,400 --> 01:03:33,830
铅鞋！
Lead shoes!

878
01:05:35,840 --> 01:05:37,350
欢迎来到我的秘密基地
Welcome to my secret hideout.

879
01:05:39,720 --> 01:05:41,470
你是，你是怎么？
How did you...

880
01:05:41,560 --> 01:05:42,620
空气
Air.

881
01:05:43,360 --> 01:05:44,990
这是我的能力
It's my peculiarity.

882
01:05:45,640 --> 01:05:47,510
它可以帮我实现想法
It does what I want.

883
01:06:06,560 --> 01:06:07,750
杰克
Jake...

884
01:06:07,920 --> 01:06:09,550
你爷爷退隐前
before your grandfather retired...

885
01:06:09,720 --> 01:06:11,870
让我保管这些
he asked me to keep this safe.

886
01:06:30,040 --> 01:06:31,350
这些是我爷爷的旧地图
This is my grandpa's old map.

887
01:06:31,520 --> 01:06:33,070
上面标记了时间圈的所在地
It shows you where the loops are.

888
01:06:44,360 --> 01:06:45,910
就是他
That's him!

889
01:06:46,080 --> 01:06:47,750
这就是我见过的那个人
That's the man I saw.

890
01:06:48,200 --> 01:06:49,910
他是谁？这就是巴伦
Who is he? That's Barron.

891
01:06:50,080 --> 01:06:51,080
他是领头人
He's the leader.

892
01:06:52,400 --> 01:06:53,750
什么的领头人？
The leader of what?

893
01:06:54,600 --> 01:06:55,790
这些人都是谁？
Who are these people?

894
01:06:57,080 --> 01:06:59,910
坏人，坏的异能者
Bad people. Bad peculiars.

895
01:07:00,720 --> 01:07:03,590
亚伯终其一生都在追捕这些人
Abe dedicated his life to hunting them down.

896
01:07:03,760 --> 01:07:05,590
这些是他没有找到的
These are the ones he never found.

897
01:07:06,440 --> 01:07:08,270
“追捕”是什么意思？
What do you mean, hunting?

898
01:07:11,280 --> 01:07:13,070
他们会袭击时间圈
They raided loops.

899
01:07:13,240 --> 01:07:16,630
残忍的杀害其中所有的孩子
Whole homes full of children left for dead.

900
01:07:17,120 --> 01:07:19,310
亚伯只是以暴制暴
Abe took lives to save lives.

901
01:07:19,480 --> 01:07:22,310
你出生后，为了保护你他就退隐了
He only retired when you were born to protect you.

902
01:07:23,400 --> 01:07:24,460
保护我什么？
From what?

903
01:07:28,600 --> 01:07:29,660
如果我告诉你全部
If I tell you the rest,

904
01:07:29,800 --> 01:07:31,830
你要保证你不逃避
you have to promise not to run away.

905
01:07:33,080 --> 01:07:36,110
杰克，你是属于这里的
Jake, you belong here.

906
01:07:36,320 --> 01:07:37,670
你知道我不属于
You know I don't.

907
01:07:37,840 --> 01:07:39,790
我和你不一样
I'm not like you.

908
01:07:40,480 --> 01:07:41,750
我是个普通人
I'm just ordinary.

909
01:07:41,920 --> 01:07:43,270
不，你不是
No, you're not.

910
01:07:43,440 --> 01:07:44,470
杰克
Jake...

911
01:07:44,640 --> 01:07:47,510
只有异能人才能进入时间圈
only a peculiar can enter a time loop.

912
01:07:50,160 --> 01:07:52,150
不是，这不可能
No. That can't be right.

913
01:07:52,800 --> 01:07:54,190
我是说，我要是异能人我应该知道
I would know.

914
01:07:55,160 --> 01:07:56,160
好吧
Fine.

915
01:07:58,160 --> 01:07:59,830
那么我就给你看看其他的
Then I'll show you something else.

916
01:08:07,320 --> 01:08:08,460
快来！会赶不上的
Hurry. You'll miss it.

917
01:08:22,320 --> 01:08:25,670
回时鸟通常会选择一个完美的日子去建立时间圈
Ymbrynes usually pick the perfect day to create a loop.

918
01:08:25,840 --> 01:08:27,800
但是佩小姐是匆忙间选择的日子
But Miss Peregrine had to make this one in a rush.

919
01:08:29,080 --> 01:08:30,080
为什么？
Why?

920
01:08:30,720 --> 01:08:32,890
因为德国人会用炸弹摧毁我们的房子
Because the Germans were about to drop a bomb on the house.

921
01:08:32,920 --> 01:08:34,350
问题是
The point is...

922
01:08:34,520 --> 01:08:37,350
1943年9月3日不是个完美的日子
September the 3rd, 1943 wasn't perfect.

923
01:08:38,680 --> 01:08:40,910
那个杀害了维克多的家伙那天又回来了
The thing that killed Victor came back.

924
01:09:08,080 --> 01:09:09,110
等等，小心！
Wait! Watch out!

925
01:09:09,880 --> 01:09:11,100
你会让她分心的！
You'll put her off!

926
01:09:39,640 --> 01:09:41,390
你能看见，是不是？
You can see it, can't you?

927
01:09:41,920 --> 01:09:43,430
没有人能看得见
No one else can.

928
01:09:43,920 --> 01:09:46,070
他们是隐形的，杰克
It's invisible, Jake.

929
01:09:46,280 --> 01:09:47,680
这就是亚伯的天赋
That was Abe's greatest gift of all.

930
01:09:50,880 --> 01:09:52,430
他可以看见那些怪物
He could see the monsters.

931
01:09:57,760 --> 01:09:59,750
我们管他们叫灵体变异人
We call them Hollowgast.

932
01:09:59,960 --> 01:10:01,100
简称灵人
Hollows for short.

933
01:10:01,960 --> 01:10:05,910
我爷爷跟我提过有变成怪物的人
My grandpa told me about people who turn into monsters.

934
01:10:06,080 --> 01:10:07,430
就是他们吗？
Is that what they are?

935
01:10:08,400 --> 01:10:10,430
我会详细跟你解释的，杰克
I will explain everything, Jake.

936
01:10:10,640 --> 01:10:12,750
考虑到现在的情况，我恐怕没得选
I fear it's my duty now, considering.

937
01:10:12,920 --> 01:10:13,970
但是你要知道
But you should know that in doing so,

938
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:15,160
我这么做的确破坏了我曾经发过的誓
I'm breaking a solemn promise.

939
01:10:18,000 --> 01:10:19,950
你一出生我就知道你是异能人
I knew you were peculiar when you were born.

940
01:10:20,480 --> 01:10:22,830
但是你爷爷让我什么都不要告诉你
But your grandfather forbid me to tell you anything.

941
01:10:23,000 --> 01:10:26,310
他最大的愿望就是希望你能有一个正常的童年
His dearest wish was for you to have an ordinary childhood.

942
01:10:26,840 --> 01:10:28,630
我的童年的确过得很平凡
I definitely had that.

943
01:10:28,800 --> 01:10:31,310
他本来打算等你18岁之后再告诉你的
He intended to tell you the truth when you turned 18.

944
01:10:31,840 --> 01:10:36,310
他希望那些睡前故事可以提前铺垫一下
He hoped his bedtime stories would pave the way.

945
01:10:38,160 --> 01:10:39,510
这是我的书
Here's my book.

946
01:10:50,880 --> 01:10:52,350
很多年前
Many years ago...

947
01:10:53,040 --> 01:10:55,790
从我们的族群中分裂出了一批人
a splinter faction emerged among our people.

948
01:10:55,960 --> 01:10:58,520
对于异能人只能存在于时间圈中非常不满意
Disaffected peculiars tired of living in loops.

949
01:10:59,200 --> 01:11:01,630
这就是巴伦先生
That's Mr. Barron.

950
01:11:01,800 --> 01:11:03,830
他认为按照他的方法
He believed that by harnessing the essence

951
01:11:03,960 --> 01:11:05,550
提取回时鸟的能力
of an Ymbryne's powers...

952
01:11:05,720 --> 01:11:08,470
他和他的同伙可以获得永生
he and his cronies could gain immortality...

953
01:11:08,640 --> 01:11:10,990
而且不用困在时间圈里
and be able to live outside loops.

954
01:11:11,200 --> 01:11:13,310
于是他就设计了一个试验
He devised an experiment.

955
01:11:16,480 --> 01:11:18,310
他绑架了一只回时鸟
He kidnapped an Ymbryne...

956
01:11:18,400 --> 01:11:19,400
在不顾那只回时鸟死活的情况下
not knowing or caring

957
01:11:19,520 --> 01:11:21,350
开始了试验
whether she would survive the experiment.

958
01:11:42,680 --> 01:11:44,790
但是巴伦和他的同伙
But the fate of Barron and his group

959
01:11:44,880 --> 01:11:46,270
下场相当惨烈
was more horrifying still.

960
01:12:23,600 --> 01:12:25,900
为什么巴伦没什么变？
Why didn't Barron turn into one?

961
01:12:39,400 --> 01:12:40,790
他变了
He did.

962
01:12:41,000 --> 01:12:42,590
可在这之后几年里
But years later...

963
01:12:42,760 --> 01:12:44,950
他发现了可以逆转异常
he found a way to reverse the effects.

964
01:12:45,120 --> 01:12:46,590
变回人类的方法
To regain humanity.

965
01:12:46,760 --> 01:12:50,110
他们变的不老不死，但是以灵人的形式存在
They had become not immortal gods, but Hollows.

966
01:12:50,280 --> 01:12:52,580
危险冷血致命的
Invisible beasts, dangerous...

967
01:12:52,800 --> 01:12:54,790
隐形怪物！
cold-blooded, deadly.

968
01:12:54,960 --> 01:12:56,680
记得我之前提过他们袭击时间圈吗？
Remember I told you they raided loops?

969
01:12:57,640 --> 01:12:58,830
这就是原因
This is why.

970
01:12:59,440 --> 01:13:01,440
巴伦发现食用其他异能人
Barron discovered that by consuming

971
01:13:01,520 --> 01:13:03,670
特别是儿童期的
the eyes of other peculiars...

972
01:13:03,840 --> 01:13:05,950
异能人的眼睛
especially children...

973
01:13:13,440 --> 01:13:14,990
可以令他恢复
he began to change.

974
01:13:33,280 --> 01:13:34,590
食用到足够多的眼睛，灵人就能
Consume enough, and a Hollow

975
01:13:34,720 --> 01:13:36,470
完全变回人形
can fully regain its human form.

976
01:13:36,680 --> 01:13:37,990
祝各位好胃口
Bon appetit.

977
01:13:38,680 --> 01:13:41,030
只有巴伦和他的同伙能够复原
Just as Barron and some of his friends did.

978
01:13:50,360 --> 01:13:52,150
其他还是以灵人的形态存在
The rest of them are stuck as Hollows.

979
01:13:54,720 --> 01:13:58,190
你是说巴伦吃了我爷爷的
Are you saying that Barron ate my grand...

980
01:13:58,360 --> 01:14:00,050
他自己已经不需要吃眼睛来维持形态了
He needs no more eyes himself.

981
01:14:00,080 --> 01:14:03,830
恐怕是他指使灵人找到了你爷爷，吃了他的眼睛
But I fear he led a Hollow to your grandfather. Yes.

982
01:14:05,640 --> 01:14:07,990
在他们第一次袭击了时间圈后
After the first attacks on loops...

983
01:14:08,160 --> 01:14:10,510
我们也开始更加注意隐蔽，建立新的时间圈
we all got better at hiding, making new loops,

984
01:14:10,640 --> 01:14:12,190
隐匿我们的行踪
keeping our whereabouts secret.

985
01:14:13,480 --> 01:14:15,860
而那些灵人变得越来越贪婪
The Hollows grow more desperate every year...

986
01:14:16,040 --> 01:14:18,670
巴伦则希望能壮大自己的队伍
and Barron wishes to help his friends.

987
01:14:18,840 --> 01:14:21,070
佩小姐！快来！艾娃塞小姐醒了
Miss Peregrine, come quickly. Miss Avocet's awake.

988
01:14:24,880 --> 01:14:26,430
突然，我又飞了进去
And suddenly, I flew into it again...

989
01:14:26,600 --> 01:14:28,830
什么都看不见
Bang! Bang! I couldn't see anything.

990
01:14:29,400 --> 01:14:31,860
佩小姐！他们发现了我新建的时间圈
Oh, Miss Peregrine. They found my new loop.

991
01:14:32,040 --> 01:14:34,910
孩子们，我想尽一切办法试图救下她们
The children. I tried to save them...

992
01:14:35,080 --> 01:14:36,670
但是灵人实在是太多了
but there were so many Hollows.

993
01:14:36,840 --> 01:14:38,550
我都不记得我是怎么逃出来的
I don't know how I escaped.

994
01:14:41,080 --> 01:14:42,220
你现在安全了
You're safe now.

995
01:14:42,400 --> 01:14:44,230
我们不可能安全的
None of us are safe.

996
01:14:44,400 --> 01:14:46,350
他们在我的时间圈里面安了装置
They set up the machine in my loop.

997
01:14:46,520 --> 01:14:48,510
装置就在黑潭塔的地下室
They put it in the cellars at Blackpool Tower.

998
01:14:48,680 --> 01:14:49,900
那些人还在那儿
They're still there.

999
01:14:50,080 --> 01:14:51,910
装置？试验用的
Their machine? The experiment.

1000
01:14:52,080 --> 01:14:54,510
他们打算再做一次试验！
They intend to do it again.

1001
01:14:54,680 --> 01:14:56,750
这次他将使用更多的回时鸟
This time, he's using more Ymbrynes.

1002
01:14:56,920 --> 01:14:58,790
他还是想获得永生
He still wants to be immortal.

1003
01:15:02,880 --> 01:15:04,790
他还是想获得永生
Do Hollows only attack peculiars?

1004
01:15:04,960 --> 01:15:06,180
当然不是！
Of course not.

1005
01:15:07,040 --> 01:15:08,310
他们就是野兽，杰克
They're monsters, Jake.

1006
01:15:08,440 --> 01:15:10,590
他们会将眼前的一切都屠杀殆尽
They'll slaughter anything in their path.

1007
01:15:10,760 --> 01:15:13,030
岛上有些羊群被杀了
Some sheep on the island were killed.

1008
01:15:13,600 --> 01:15:15,790
他们不会已经到了这里吧？
You don't think they're here already, do you?

1009
01:15:16,320 --> 01:15:18,230
你有看到长着白色眼睛的人吗？
Have you seen anyone with white eyes?

1010
01:15:22,800 --> 01:15:24,750
孩子们，很抱歉，我们不能继续住在这儿了
I'm sorry, children. We can't remain here.

1011
01:15:24,920 --> 01:15:25,920
什么？
What?

1012
01:15:26,120 --> 01:15:28,280
我们乘坐明早第一班渡船离开这里
We'll leave on the first ferry off the island tomorrow.

1013
01:15:28,440 --> 01:15:30,110
回去收拾行李
Pack anything of importance.

1014
01:15:30,240 --> 01:15:31,950
我去做些三明治然后哄你们上床睡觉
Then it's sandwiches and early to bed.

1015
01:15:32,120 --> 01:15:33,430
离开就再也不会来了吗？
Are we leaving for good?

1016
01:15:33,600 --> 01:15:35,270
我们什么时候再回来？不会再回来了
When are we coming back? Never.

1017
01:15:35,440 --> 01:15:36,520
如果佩小姐明天晚上
If Miss Peregrine's not here

1018
01:15:36,600 --> 01:15:37,990
不重置时间圈
to reset the loop tomorrow night...

1019
01:15:38,160 --> 01:15:39,160
这房子就彻底被炸毁了
the house gets bombed.

1020
01:15:39,320 --> 01:15:40,460
什么？我们的房子？
But our house.

1021
01:15:40,680 --> 01:15:41,710
别哭
Don't cry.

1022
01:15:41,800 --> 01:15:42,920
佩小姐会给你们
Miss Peregrine will find you

1023
01:15:42,960 --> 01:15:44,400
重新找一座漂亮房子的
another lovely house, somewhere else.

1024
01:15:51,560 --> 01:15:53,430
一旦这个时间圈关闭
Once this loop closes, that's it.

1025
01:15:53,600 --> 01:15:55,390
我就再也不能回到自己的时空了
I can't get back to my own time.

1026
01:15:55,880 --> 01:15:57,430
你在那里过得也不是很开心啊
You didn't seem very happy there.

1027
01:15:57,600 --> 01:16:00,950
我不能就这么走了！我还有家人
I can't just leave! I have a family!

1028
01:16:01,160 --> 01:16:02,510
你一直觉得自己平凡
And you felt ordinary.

1029
01:16:02,680 --> 01:16:05,110
觉得自己什么都不能改变
Like, nothing you do changes anything!

1030
01:16:05,280 --> 01:16:06,870
现在你有一个机会
Now you have a chance to do something

1031
01:16:06,960 --> 01:16:08,390
可以拯救世界
that changes everything!

1032
01:16:09,320 --> 01:16:11,310
杰克，我们现在有危险
Jake, we're in danger.

1033
01:16:11,480 --> 01:16:13,940
而你是我们中唯一一个可以看见灵人的
And you're the only one who can see the Hollows.

1034
01:16:14,120 --> 01:16:17,150
是，我确实可以看见他们，但是我不是我爷爷
Yeah, see them, sure. But I'm not my grandpa!

1035
01:16:18,160 --> 01:16:20,350
我不是，我不知道怎么去战斗
I'm not, and I can't fight.

1036
01:16:20,520 --> 01:16:22,110
我不会杀人
I can't kill somebody.

1037
01:16:25,920 --> 01:16:28,550
只有一个理由可以让我留下来
There's only one reason that I'd stay here...

1038
01:16:28,720 --> 01:16:29,720
别说了！
Please.

1039
01:16:30,760 --> 01:16:32,270
你走吧
Just go.

1040
01:17:00,800 --> 01:17:03,360
杰克，杰克原来你在这儿！
Jake? Jakey, there you are.

1041
01:17:03,520 --> 01:17:04,550
谢天谢地！
Thank God!

1042
01:17:04,760 --> 01:17:06,950
听他们说找到了一具尸体时吓死我了
When I heard they found a body, I freaked.

1043
01:17:31,600 --> 01:17:33,270
这儿也有流浪狗吗？
Are there stray dogs around here?

1044
01:17:34,120 --> 01:17:35,120
你说什么？
What you talking about?

1045
01:17:36,640 --> 01:17:38,190
我是说
It's like...

1046
01:17:38,360 --> 01:17:39,830
流浪狗发现受伤的动物后
when they find an injured animal,

1047
01:17:39,920 --> 01:17:41,990
会先吃掉其中的软组织
they go for the soft parts first.

1048
01:17:43,480 --> 01:17:45,070
我父亲去世的时候也是这样
Same thing happened to my father.

1049
01:17:45,840 --> 01:17:48,030
警察已经快到了
The police are on their way.

1050
01:17:49,160 --> 01:17:50,430
爸爸，我得走了
Look, Dad. I've gotta go.

1051
01:17:50,640 --> 01:17:52,670
不行，你那儿也不能去，杰克
What? No. You don't, Jake.

1052
01:17:53,400 --> 01:17:54,480
如果这不是意外
If this wasn't an accident,

1053
01:17:54,560 --> 01:17:55,800
那就是这个岛上有个疯子
there's a lunatic on the island.

1054
01:17:56,280 --> 01:17:58,840
我认识这个岛上的每一个人
I've known everyone on this island my whole life.

1055
01:17:59,000 --> 01:18:00,870
除了你和他
Except you, and him.

1056
01:18:01,440 --> 01:18:02,850
而他在酒吧里坐了一下午
And he's been in the pub all afternoon.

1057
01:18:02,880 --> 01:18:04,790
我也是，我一直都在睡觉
So have I. I was sleeping.

1058
01:18:04,960 --> 01:18:06,640
那个盲人呢？
What about the blind fellow?

1059
01:18:06,760 --> 01:18:09,140
我以为他也是个盲人
I assumed he was blind.

1060
01:18:09,320 --> 01:18:10,870
一个戴墨镜的先生
Gentleman with the dark glasses...

1061
01:18:11,080 --> 01:18:13,030
是和我同一天坐渡轮一起过来的
arrived on the same ferry as me?

1062
01:18:13,200 --> 01:18:15,070
我总能看见他在这附近
I kept seeing him around.

1063
01:18:15,800 --> 01:18:16,830
杰克！
Jake!

1064
01:18:17,600 --> 01:18:18,630
杰克！
Jake!

1065
01:18:19,320 --> 01:18:22,430
杰克，等等！
Jake! Wait!

1066
01:18:26,880 --> 01:18:28,230
你儿子还好吧？
Is your son all right?

1067
01:18:28,400 --> 01:18:29,400
不好
No.

1068
01:18:29,480 --> 01:18:32,790
他有心理障碍
He has mental health issues.

1069
01:18:32,960 --> 01:18:33,990
我追不上
I can't go.

1070
01:18:34,080 --> 01:18:36,460
我帮你追，我经常会来个5公里跑
Let me. I run 5-Ks all the time.

1071
01:18:50,400 --> 01:18:51,400
你好！
Hello?

1072
01:18:56,040 --> 01:18:57,070
你好？
Hello?

1073
01:18:58,120 --> 01:18:59,430
是你吗，年轻人？
Is that you, young man?

1074
01:19:01,200 --> 01:19:02,510
你能进入？
You came through...

1075
01:19:03,480 --> 01:19:04,830
你是个异能人？
You're peculiar?

1076
01:19:05,960 --> 01:19:07,100
是的
Oh, yes.

1077
01:19:08,120 --> 01:19:11,030
真是多亏了你
And I'm extremely grateful to you.

1078
01:19:11,760 --> 01:19:14,220
这些日子想要找到时间圈越来越难了
Terribly hard to find loops these days.

1079
01:19:15,200 --> 01:19:17,990
你故意从海滩那儿一直尾随我？
So, you followed me from the beach on purpose?

1080
01:19:18,600 --> 01:19:19,790
不不不
Oh, no.

1081
01:19:20,400 --> 01:19:23,310
我在很早以前就已经开始关注你了！
I've been following you much further than that.

1082
01:19:28,600 --> 01:19:30,070
格兰医生？
Doctor Golan?

1083
01:19:30,600 --> 01:19:31,660
有时候
Sometimes.

1084
01:19:32,320 --> 01:19:33,710
合适的时候
When it suits me.

1085
01:19:34,560 --> 01:19:37,430
一般来说能够局限我异能变化的
The breadth of my peculiarity...

1086
01:19:37,600 --> 01:19:40,510
只有我的想象力
is purely limited by my imagination.

1087
01:19:41,440 --> 01:19:43,630
只有一样我没有办法改变
The only thing I can't change...

1088
01:19:46,520 --> 01:19:48,310
就是我的眼睛
is my eyes.

1089
01:19:54,320 --> 01:19:56,780
我是巴伦先生，你好吗？
Mr. Barron. How do you do?

1090
01:20:00,240 --> 01:20:03,270
我在你爷爷家见过你
I saw you at your grandfather's.

1091
01:20:04,160 --> 01:20:05,190
我本打算从他那儿
I was hoping to get

1092
01:20:05,320 --> 01:20:06,530
得到佩小姐的地址
Miss Peregrine's address from him.

1093
01:20:06,560 --> 01:20:08,350
但是和我一起过来的旅伴
But, alas, my traveling companion

1094
01:20:08,440 --> 01:20:10,230
先我一步找到了他
got to him before I did.

1095
01:20:10,960 --> 01:20:12,150
如你所知
As you know...

1096
01:20:12,320 --> 01:20:15,860
没什么能阻止饥饿的灵人捕食
there's just no stopping a hungry Hollowgast!

1097
01:20:19,480 --> 01:20:22,310
说到我那个同伴
Speaking of my traveling companion...

1098
01:20:23,880 --> 01:20:24,910
他已经在来的路上了
he's coming.

1099
01:20:25,320 --> 01:20:27,910
劝你还是相信我说的
Believe me when I say to you...

1100
01:20:28,080 --> 01:20:30,910
当他到这儿之后
you don't want to be here...

1101
01:20:31,080 --> 01:20:33,110
你绝对不会想留下来了
when he arrives.

1102
01:20:34,480 --> 01:20:37,630
我们继续往前走吧
So, let's be on our way.

1103
01:20:38,760 --> 01:20:39,790
请吧
Shall we?

1104
01:20:45,480 --> 01:20:46,830
借过
Excuse me.

1105
01:20:51,760 --> 01:20:52,790
等等我
Wait for me.

1106
01:20:57,160 --> 01:20:58,490
日历必须要拿上
I mustn't forget our calendar.

1107
01:20:58,520 --> 01:20:59,650
能帮我去客厅拿一下吗
Could you fetch it from the parlor

1108
01:20:59,680 --> 01:21:00,820
艾娃塞小姐？
please, Miss Avocet?

1109
01:21:04,720 --> 01:21:06,150
去帮助其他人吧
Go and help the others.

1110
01:21:19,520 --> 01:21:21,590
佩小姐
Miss Peregrine, what a pleasure

1111
01:21:21,680 --> 01:21:22,950
终于有机会见到你了！
to meet you at last!

1112
01:21:24,240 --> 01:21:26,030
我们能进来吗？
May we come in?

1113
01:21:32,920 --> 01:21:34,030
孩子们
Children!

1114
01:21:34,440 --> 01:21:37,350
你们都下来吧
Would you make your way down the stairs, please?

1115
01:21:37,520 --> 01:21:40,270
巴伦先生！这座房子里轮不到你来下命令
I give the orders in this house, Mr. Barron.

1116
01:21:40,440 --> 01:21:41,500
今天不行
Not today.

1117
01:21:42,000 --> 01:21:45,470
杰克已经完成他的任务
You should know that Jake has served his purpose.

1118
01:21:45,640 --> 01:21:47,350
如果你们还想保他的命，我建议
If you value his life, I suggest

1119
01:21:47,440 --> 01:21:49,820
听我的！
everyone does as they're told.

1120
01:21:50,000 --> 01:21:51,550
- 孩子们！
- 嘘！
Children! Shush!

1121
01:21:52,640 --> 01:21:55,350
没人可以命令他们
No one tells my children what to do!

1122
01:21:57,040 --> 01:21:58,040
孩子们
Children...

1123
01:21:58,440 --> 01:22:00,390
都下楼到这里来吧
come down here, please.

1124
01:22:03,720 --> 01:22:04,750
佩小姐
Miss Peregrine...

1125
01:22:04,840 --> 01:22:06,670
我说过让你安静！
I thought I told you to be quiet.

1126
01:22:09,560 --> 01:22:10,620
孩子们
Children...

1127
01:22:10,800 --> 01:22:12,750
为了杰克的安全
for Jake's safety...

1128
01:22:12,920 --> 01:22:15,380
我们现在要按巴伦先生说的做
we're going to do what Mr. Barron asks.

1129
01:22:16,080 --> 01:22:17,300
他希望我
He wishes to take me with him

1130
01:22:17,400 --> 01:22:18,870
跟他一起去黑池
to his rendezvous in Blackpool.

1131
01:22:19,040 --> 01:22:20,630
为了保护自己
So, for his protection...

1132
01:22:20,800 --> 01:22:22,230
他希望我变成鸟的样子
he'd like me to assume bird form,

1133
01:22:22,320 --> 01:22:23,750
最好是在笼子里
preferably caged.

1134
01:22:23,920 --> 01:22:25,990
他还想把你们也全部锁起来
He'd like you to make your way into a lockable room,

1135
01:22:26,080 --> 01:22:27,510
比如客厅
such as the parlor...

1136
01:22:27,680 --> 01:22:29,310
如果令他感到
as he won't release Jake if he fears

1137
01:22:29,400 --> 01:22:30,880
有一丝的不安全
an attack could be mounted upon him...

1138
01:22:30,960 --> 01:22:32,630
他都不会放杰克走
once he loses his leverage.

1139
01:22:33,320 --> 01:22:34,590
是这样么，巴伦先生？
Correct, Mr. Barron?

1140
01:22:35,960 --> 01:22:37,960
你准备牺牲自己和我们
You're sacrificing yourself and all of us...

1141
01:22:38,800 --> 01:22:39,990
仅仅为了救杰克？
for Jake?

1142
01:22:40,160 --> 01:22:42,830
巴伦先生带着一只空灵，伊诺克
Mr. Barron travels with a Hollow, Enoch.

1143
01:22:43,000 --> 01:22:46,030
它一旦来这里，我们都得死
Once it arrives here, we're all dead.

1144
01:22:47,680 --> 01:22:50,790
伊诺克，只有杰克能看到空灵们
Enoch. Only Jake can see them.

1145
01:22:50,960 --> 01:22:52,950
他是我们唯一的希望
She means he's our only hope.

1146
01:23:37,320 --> 01:23:39,110
能照顾你们
It's been my privilege...

1147
01:23:40,040 --> 01:23:41,670
是我的荣幸
to care for you all.

1148
01:23:44,280 --> 01:23:45,630
再见！孩子们
Goodbye, my children.

1149
01:23:55,560 --> 01:23:56,560
你现在可以放开他了
Now let him go.

1150
01:24:19,880 --> 01:24:21,070
杰克，答应我
Promise me one thing, Jake.

1151
01:24:24,720 --> 01:24:27,070
你会尽力照顾他们所有人
That you will try to look after them all.

1152
01:24:30,880 --> 01:24:32,310
我答应你
I promise.

1153
01:25:08,800 --> 01:25:09,800
天要黑了
It's getting dark.

1154
01:25:10,200 --> 01:25:12,030
到时候连它们的影子都看不到了
You won't even be able to see their shadows.

1155
01:25:12,200 --> 01:25:13,260
我们必须待在房子里
We have to stay inside.

1156
01:25:13,360 --> 01:25:14,950
这样我们或许还有一丝生机
It's the only place we stand a chance.

1157
01:25:15,120 --> 01:25:16,830
他说的对，佩小姐平时
He's quite right. Now, where does

1158
01:25:16,920 --> 01:25:18,430
都把武器放在哪里？
Miss Peregrine keep her weapon?

1159
01:25:18,960 --> 01:25:20,390
这边，跟我来
In there. Let's go.

1160
01:25:20,560 --> 01:25:21,950
孩子们
Now, all right, children.

1161
01:25:22,120 --> 01:25:23,330
去把每一扇门窗
Make sure all the doors are locked,

1162
01:25:23,360 --> 01:25:25,030
都关好，锁好
and the windows are latched.

1163
01:25:25,200 --> 01:25:27,470
全都牢牢关好，快去
Everything must be sealed up tight. Now quickly.

1164
01:25:27,680 --> 01:25:28,790
快去！
Quickly! Go!

1165
01:25:39,440 --> 01:25:40,470
这儿
Here.

1166
01:25:44,120 --> 01:25:46,830
杰克，最好你去接
Jake, I think tonight, you better answer that.

1167
01:25:47,000 --> 01:25:48,000
好
Okay.

1168
01:25:52,440 --> 01:25:53,470
喂？
Hello?

1169
01:25:53,560 --> 01:25:54,770
你好，我是亚伯
Hello, this is Abe.

1170
01:25:54,800 --> 01:25:55,910
你是哪位？
Who's that?

1171
01:26:00,640 --> 01:26:03,550
你…你不认识我，我是杰克
You don't know me yet. I'm Jake.

1172
01:26:03,760 --> 01:26:06,910
哦，你是新来的，欢迎来到这个大家庭，杰克
Ah, you're new. Welcome to the family, Jake.

1173
01:26:07,080 --> 01:26:08,510
我不能讲太久
Now, I can't talk long...

1174
01:26:08,720 --> 01:26:09,990
帮我告诉佩小姐
so just tell Miss Peregrine...

1175
01:26:10,160 --> 01:26:12,150
我在空军基地，我一切都好
I'm at the air base, and I'm fine.

1176
01:26:15,040 --> 01:26:18,740
我想告诉你，我很想你
I just wanted to say that I miss you...

1177
01:26:19,600 --> 01:26:21,550
如果我让你失望了
and if I disappointed you...

1178
01:26:21,720 --> 01:26:23,150
对不起
I'm sorry.

1179
01:26:24,080 --> 01:26:26,910
还有，你是世界上最好的爷爷
You're the best grandpa in the world.

1180
01:26:51,440 --> 01:26:53,110
菲奥娜！
Fiona. Got it.

1181
01:26:54,240 --> 01:26:55,240
艾维赛小姐！
Miss Avocet.

1182
01:26:56,080 --> 01:26:57,140
孩子们
Now, children.

1183
01:26:57,320 --> 01:26:59,430
有几条命令大家要记住
Now that you're all here, there's a few rules.

1184
01:26:59,600 --> 01:27:01,950
你们一定要保证自己的安全
Your primary job is to stay safe.

1185
01:27:02,120 --> 01:27:03,390
空灵留着我来对付
Leave the Hollow to me.

1186
01:27:03,560 --> 01:27:05,390
千万不要逞英雄
I don't want to see any heroics.

1187
01:27:06,280 --> 01:27:08,190
拿着农具的孩子，要记住
Now those of you with garden tools...

1188
01:27:08,360 --> 01:27:10,510
你们…
I must insist that you...

1189
01:27:33,440 --> 01:27:34,750
不，伊诺克！回来！
No, Enoch. Get back!

1190
01:28:01,160 --> 01:28:02,190
快跑！去阁楼
Go. Get to the attic!

1191
01:28:06,320 --> 01:28:07,320
接着她！
Take her.

1192
01:28:21,600 --> 01:28:23,390
走！走！
Go. Get out!

1193
01:28:24,600 --> 01:28:25,600
奥利芙，快走！
Olive, come on!

1194
01:28:43,920 --> 01:28:45,590
糟了！要到重置时间了
Crap! It's almost reset!

1195
01:28:50,360 --> 01:28:52,660
菲奥娜，你能让那棵树长过来么？
Fiona, is there anything you can do with that tree?

1196
01:28:52,840 --> 01:28:54,510
小心点！
Be careful.

1197
01:28:57,960 --> 01:28:59,230
我们从这边窗户出去
We're going through the windows.

1198
01:28:59,320 --> 01:29:00,540
快走，快一点！
Let's go! Quickly!

1199
01:29:24,800 --> 01:29:25,860
过来！
Come on!

1200
01:29:36,680 --> 01:29:38,150
克莱尔！快下来
Claire, come on down.

1201
01:29:57,680 --> 01:29:59,430
小心点
Be careful.

1202
01:30:11,880 --> 01:30:13,390
菲奥娜，快走！
Go, Fiona!

1203
01:30:21,080 --> 01:30:22,140
快跑！
Let's go!

1204
01:30:46,160 --> 01:30:47,950
- 怎么回事？
- 时间圈关闭了
- Was that...
- The loop closing.

1205
01:30:49,400 --> 01:30:50,670
全都没了
It's gone.

1206
01:31:11,920 --> 01:31:13,140
对不起，杰克
I'm sorry, Jake.

1207
01:31:13,960 --> 01:31:15,670
我们现在怎么办？
What do we do now?

1208
01:31:17,120 --> 01:31:19,270
有没有巴伦和佩小姐的踪迹？
Is there any sign of Barron and Miss Peregrine?

1209
01:31:19,800 --> 01:31:22,630
他们走了，巴伦一定是乘船走了
Gone. Barron must have had a boat.

1210
01:31:27,360 --> 01:31:28,830
我们必须去找他们
We have to go after them.

1211
01:31:29,440 --> 01:31:31,110
至少我们知道他们要去黑池
We know he's taking her to Blackpool.

1212
01:31:31,280 --> 01:31:33,110
黑池离这儿那么远
But Blackpool is miles away.

1213
01:31:33,280 --> 01:31:34,570
况且下一班船要再等好几个小时
The next ferry doesn't go for hours.

1214
01:31:34,600 --> 01:31:35,820
我们来不及了
We'll never make it in time.

1215
01:31:37,600 --> 01:31:39,550
除非我们现在就有条船！
Not unless we go by boat, too.

1216
01:33:26,200 --> 01:33:27,990
在黑池这里有一个时间圈
So, there's a loop here in Blackpool.

1217
01:33:28,200 --> 01:33:31,550
只有六个月，是2016年1月11号
It's only six months old. January 11th, 2016.

1218
01:33:31,720 --> 01:33:34,510
但现在艾维赛小姐不在了，这个时间圈就无法维持
With Miss Avocet gone, it can't be reset.

1219
01:33:34,680 --> 01:33:36,470
时间圈会关闭么？
Won't the loop close?

1220
01:33:37,160 --> 01:33:38,710
它就会回到现实时间
Then it's back to real time.

1221
01:33:40,880 --> 01:33:43,030
杰克，你知道这意味什么么？
Jake, you know what this means, don't you?

1222
01:33:43,720 --> 01:33:44,860
你会死
You're gonna die.

1223
01:33:45,040 --> 01:33:46,910
我不是这个意思
That's not what I mean.

1224
01:33:47,080 --> 01:33:48,390
我们需要回到自己的时间里
We have to get to our own time,

1225
01:33:48,560 --> 01:33:49,560
但你不用
but you don't.

1226
01:33:50,360 --> 01:33:53,670
你可以继续生活在2016年
You can continue to live in 2016.

1227
01:33:53,840 --> 01:33:55,430
为什么？
But why would I do that?

1228
01:33:55,600 --> 01:33:57,190
如果我们杀死巴伦
If we kill Barron...

1229
01:33:57,400 --> 01:34:00,030
他死了，时间会继续向前
he'll be gone, but time will carry on.

1230
01:34:00,760 --> 01:34:02,550
他就不会去佛罗里达
He won't go to Florida...

1231
01:34:03,400 --> 01:34:07,180
亚伯不会死，你也可以回家了
Abe won't die, and you can go home.

1232
01:34:08,880 --> 01:34:11,070
我能看到爷爷了
I could see my grandpa.

1233
01:34:15,720 --> 01:34:18,230
我可以向他们解释发生的所有事情！
Listen, I can explain everything to them.

1234
01:34:18,400 --> 01:34:21,350
我可以让他们再带我回到岛上
I can persuade them to take me to the island and...

1235
01:34:21,520 --> 01:34:23,550
你们还会在那里么？
Wait, will you still be there?

1236
01:34:25,200 --> 01:34:27,390
我们的旧时间圈永远结束了
Our old loop's gone for good.

1237
01:34:28,400 --> 01:34:30,350
我们不会再见的
We wouldn't see each other again.

1238
01:34:32,080 --> 01:34:34,230
我以为你想让我留下来
I thought you wanted me to stay.

1239
01:34:36,960 --> 01:34:39,190
我知道你更想见到亚伯
I know you'll choose Abe.

1240
01:34:39,920 --> 01:34:42,750
如果我真想你留下，就不会告诉你这些了
If I minded, I wouldn't have told you

1241
01:34:51,560 --> 01:34:53,230
找到艾维赛小姐的
So, have you found Miss Avocet's

1242
01:34:53,320 --> 01:34:54,590
时间圈了么？
loop on the map yet?

1243
01:34:55,480 --> 01:34:57,310
在这里，是新建的
It's here. But it's new.

1244
01:34:57,480 --> 01:34:59,940
是今年初刚建立的
She made it early this year. That's my year.

1245
01:35:00,120 --> 01:35:01,560
如果我们不能在时间圈关闭前出来
If we don't get out before it closes,

1246
01:35:01,640 --> 01:35:03,390
我们都要被困在2016年1月了
we're stuck in January 2016.

1247
01:35:03,480 --> 01:35:04,510
很好！
Great.

1248
01:35:04,600 --> 01:35:06,350
我们全都被时间困住
Time catches up with all of us,

1249
01:35:06,440 --> 01:35:08,270
都会死，除了你！有什么计划么？
we all die, except you. Plan?

1250
01:35:08,760 --> 01:35:10,470
时间圈在4:30关闭
The loop closes at 4:30.

1251
01:35:10,680 --> 01:35:11,870
我们需要抓紧进入时间圈
That means we need to get in,

1252
01:35:11,960 --> 01:35:13,400
救出回时鸟，然后尽快出来
rescue the Ymbrynes and then get out.

1253
01:35:14,120 --> 01:35:16,070
前提是我们还活着
Yeah, if we're not already dead.

1254
01:35:16,240 --> 01:35:18,000
艾维赛小姐说过机器
Miss Avocet said the machine is in the cellar

1255
01:35:18,120 --> 01:35:19,290
在黑池塔的地窖里
of the Blackpool Tower building.

1256
01:35:19,320 --> 01:35:22,070
也就是说我们要跟空灵面对面
That means we will be indoors... with Hollows.

1257
01:35:22,240 --> 01:35:24,590
不…不需要！我有一个计划
No, we won't. I've got a plan.

1258
01:35:24,760 --> 01:35:26,270
但我需要你们的帮助
But I'm gonna need your help.

1259
01:35:56,880 --> 01:35:58,510
不会是这里吧？
This can't be it, can it?

1260
01:35:59,120 --> 01:36:01,070
任何地方都可能是时间圈入口？
Loop entrances can be anywhere.

1261
01:36:01,160 --> 01:36:03,350
在伦敦的入口是一个地铁隧道
The one in London's in a subway tunnel.

1262
01:36:16,040 --> 01:36:17,350
你确定是这个？
Are you sure this is it?

1263
01:36:20,400 --> 01:36:22,190
我觉得是
I think so.

1264
01:36:24,040 --> 01:36:26,390
米拉德，我现在需要你…
Millard, there's something I need you to do first.

1265
01:36:26,560 --> 01:36:28,860
我知道
All right. I know.

1266
01:36:32,240 --> 01:36:34,750
看！那就是黑池塔，不远
Look. There's the tower. It's not far.

1267
01:36:34,920 --> 01:36:37,590
说得简单！我可冻死了
Easy for you to say. I'm freezing.

1268
01:36:43,720 --> 01:36:44,860
准备好了么？
Ready?

1269
01:36:55,880 --> 01:36:58,180
所有通往地窖的通道都被封了
All of the doors to the cellar are locked.

1270
01:36:58,360 --> 01:37:00,400
唯一能找到回时鸟的路就是那里
The only way to reach the Ymbrynes is through there.

1271
01:37:01,040 --> 01:37:02,350
就是通过那个后台
It's backstage.

1272
01:37:02,520 --> 01:37:04,550
你能看到多少个空灵
How many Hollows can you see?

1273
01:37:05,520 --> 01:37:07,350
4个，算是个好消息
Four. That's good news.

1274
01:37:07,920 --> 01:37:09,140
咱俩对好消息的
I think you and I have

1275
01:37:09,240 --> 01:37:10,910
定义可不同
very different definition of good news.

1276
01:37:11,080 --> 01:37:14,230
这也就意味着巴伦的其他朋友还没到…
It means Barron's other friends haven't arrived yet.

1277
01:37:14,400 --> 01:37:16,070
他们还没开始做实验
So they haven't started the experiment.

1278
01:37:16,960 --> 01:37:18,390
所以我们还不晚
We're not too late.

1279
01:37:20,240 --> 01:37:21,240
艾玛
Okay, Emma.

1280
01:37:21,920 --> 01:37:23,630
你好了么？你知道要说什么
You ready? You know what to say.

1281
01:37:23,800 --> 01:37:25,110
杰克
Here, Jake.

1282
01:37:27,560 --> 01:37:31,030
其他兄弟马上就会来加入我们
Our brethren should be joining us momentarily.

1283
01:37:31,240 --> 01:37:32,790
今天是个…
This is a day to...

1284
01:37:32,960 --> 01:37:34,470
下面的听着
You down there!

1285
01:37:34,600 --> 01:37:37,060
巴伦先生，我们杀了你的空灵兄弟
We killed your Hollow friend, Mr. Barron.

1286
01:37:37,240 --> 01:37:39,750
现在我们来救佩小姐了
And now we've come for Miss Peregrine.

1287
01:37:39,920 --> 01:37:41,430
五分钟内带着佩瑞格林小姐
Bring her and all the other Ymbrynes

1288
01:37:41,560 --> 01:37:43,590
和其他的回时鸟去码头
to the end of the pier in five minutes...

1289
01:37:43,760 --> 01:37:45,470
不然有你好看的
or face the consequences.

1290
01:37:49,640 --> 01:37:51,190
这些孩子们一定是
These children must be

1291
01:37:51,280 --> 01:37:53,310
像他们的校长一样疯了
as insane as their headmistress.

1292
01:37:53,920 --> 01:37:57,790
空灵们可是很喜欢饱餐一顿呢
Still, the Hollows will be glad of a feed.

1293
01:38:00,640 --> 01:38:02,270
你们在哪儿呢？
Where are you?

1294
01:38:03,000 --> 01:38:05,790
我知道你们在这儿
I know you're in here somewhere!

1295
01:38:08,800 --> 01:38:10,910
听着
Good. Listen to me.

1296
01:38:11,080 --> 01:38:14,950
我要你们跟着阿彻先生和克拉克先生
I want you to follow Mr. Archer and Mr. Clark.

1297
01:38:15,120 --> 01:38:16,880
他们会带你们去码头
They're going to take you down to the pier...

1298
01:38:17,000 --> 01:38:20,150
吃个下午茶
for a little afternoon tea.

1299
01:38:21,040 --> 01:38:22,990
阿彻先生，克拉克先生
Mr. Archer, Mr. Clark...

1300
01:38:23,160 --> 01:38:25,190
请带着空灵们去码头吧
gather the Hollows and take them to the pier.

1301
01:38:25,360 --> 01:38:27,740
这几个孩子杀了马尔萨斯？
Those children killed Malthus?

1302
01:38:27,960 --> 01:38:29,310
自从马尔萨斯杀了亚伯·波特曼
Barron's had it in for Malthus

1303
01:38:29,440 --> 01:38:31,150
巴伦先生就想干掉他
ever since he killed Abe Portman.

1304
01:38:31,320 --> 01:38:33,310
我跟踪了他好几个月
I tracked Abe Portman for months.

1305
01:38:35,440 --> 01:38:36,990
我当时只需要几分钟
All I needed was a few minutes...

1306
01:38:37,160 --> 01:38:40,030
来问出佩小姐的时间圈地址
to get the location of Miss Peregrine's loop from him.

1307
01:38:40,200 --> 01:38:41,470
但是不行
But no!

1308
01:38:41,680 --> 01:38:43,510
马尔萨斯等不及
Malthus couldn't wait.

1309
01:38:44,000 --> 01:38:45,140
所以呢
Instead...

1310
01:38:46,120 --> 01:38:49,550
我就必须得在那
I had to masquerade as a psychiatrist...

1311
01:38:49,720 --> 01:38:52,100
待上三个星期
for three weeks...

1312
01:38:52,320 --> 01:38:53,670
伪装成心理医生
in Florida!

1313
01:38:55,640 --> 01:38:57,510
你去过佛罗里达么？
Have you ever been to Florida?

1314
01:39:01,560 --> 01:39:04,390
我不是让你们带着空灵们去码头？
Did I not tell you to gather the Hollows?

1315
01:39:04,560 --> 01:39:05,560
万一是个陷阱怎么办
What if it's a trap?

1316
01:39:05,720 --> 01:39:07,830
爱德华小姐，肯定是个陷阱咯，但那又怎样？
Of course, it is, Miss Edwards. But what of it?

1317
01:39:08,040 --> 01:39:10,390
几个小屁孩对空灵就是自寻死路
A couple of children against four Hollows.

1318
01:39:10,560 --> 01:39:12,070
赶紧行动啊
Let's get this over with.

1319
01:39:31,720 --> 01:39:32,720
杰克，我被电线卡住了
Jake, I'm stuck!

1320
01:39:39,240 --> 01:39:40,240
快！
Hurry up!

1321
01:39:44,200 --> 01:39:45,830
小心
Watch out!

1322
01:40:01,760 --> 01:40:02,820
他们来了！
They're coming!

1323
01:40:17,920 --> 01:40:18,920
快走
Let's go.

1324
01:40:27,120 --> 01:40:28,870
就现在伊诺克！
Enoch. Now!

1325
01:40:47,640 --> 01:40:48,640
动手！
Go! Now!

1326
01:41:01,800 --> 01:41:02,940
可以看见了
Starting to see them now.

1327
01:41:05,960 --> 01:41:06,960
第二步
Phase two.

1328
01:41:12,120 --> 01:41:13,120
艾玛！快！
Emma, go.

1329
01:41:16,840 --> 01:41:18,790
别傻站在这儿！去抓住他们！
Don't just stand there. Get them!

1330
01:43:05,600 --> 01:43:08,550
干得好，孩子们，可以开始第二步计划了
All right. Good job, guys. It's time for step two.

1331
01:43:08,720 --> 01:43:10,110
救出佩瑞格林小姐
Save Miss Peregrine!

1332
01:43:10,280 --> 01:43:11,790
呃…那算是第三步
That's sort of step three.

1333
01:43:11,920 --> 01:43:13,590
在这之前我们得先把巴伦解决了
First, we've got to deal with Barron.

1334
01:43:17,960 --> 01:43:19,750
他们现在该回来了
They should've been back by now.

1335
01:43:19,960 --> 01:43:21,310
我就说是个陷阱
I said it was a trap.

1336
01:43:21,480 --> 01:43:22,950
如果真是这样
If that's true...

1337
01:43:23,920 --> 01:43:26,790
我们要转移回时鸟了
perhaps we should move the Ymbrynes now.

1338
01:43:26,960 --> 01:43:28,310
你认真的么？
You're not serious?

1339
01:43:28,480 --> 01:43:30,780
我看起来像开玩笑的么？
Do I not look serious?

1340
01:43:30,960 --> 01:43:34,310
是谁跋山涉水
Do I not look like a man who has searched the globe...

1341
01:43:34,520 --> 01:43:36,980
就为了多吃一个眼睛
looking for just one more eye to eat...

1342
01:43:37,640 --> 01:43:39,940
多点儿人性
in hopes of regaining sufficient humanity...

1343
01:43:40,120 --> 01:43:42,230
好继续他的研究？
to return to his research?

1344
01:43:42,440 --> 01:43:45,000
是谁不遗余力花费数年
A man who's spent years hunting Ymbrynes...

1345
01:43:45,160 --> 01:43:47,990
抓起这些回时鸟就为了今晚？
in preparation for this night...

1346
01:43:48,200 --> 01:43:50,950
整整两…不…三天都待在威尔士
and two, no, three days, in Wales...

1347
01:43:51,160 --> 01:43:53,670
装作在观鸟
pretending to look at birds!

1348
01:43:53,840 --> 01:43:55,190
我告诉你
I assure you...

1349
01:43:55,360 --> 01:43:57,590
我不会傻傻站在这里
I will not stand idly by...

1350
01:43:58,640 --> 01:44:02,150
眼看着一切脱离我的计划
to see my destiny derailed.

1351
01:44:08,960 --> 01:44:10,150
休，就现在！
Hugh, do it now!

1352
01:44:24,680 --> 01:44:25,820
回来！
Come back here!

1353
01:44:26,000 --> 01:44:27,000
给我抓住他们！
Get them!

1354
01:44:34,840 --> 01:44:35,840
下去！
Go. Get down!

1355
01:44:38,320 --> 01:44:41,670
你以为你能阻止我？
You think you can stand in my way?

1356
01:44:42,160 --> 01:44:46,030
杰克，如果你没有这点儿异能
You, Jake, content to age and die...

1357
01:44:46,200 --> 01:44:49,950
你是不是就满足于生老病死的生活？
as if you had not the gift of peculiarity at all?

1358
01:44:55,240 --> 01:44:58,550
我更高级
I am a higher being.

1359
01:44:58,720 --> 01:45:01,870
我知道永生的方法
I hold the secret to eternal life!

1360
01:45:02,040 --> 01:45:03,180
抱歉，打扰一下
Sorry to interrupt.

1361
01:45:03,720 --> 01:45:05,190
什么…
What the...

1362
01:45:16,520 --> 01:45:17,520
布朗温
Bronwyn.

1363
01:45:23,760 --> 01:45:25,230
杰克，你又没打中
You missed me again, Jake.

1364
01:45:25,400 --> 01:45:28,550
我猜射的准肯定不是你的异能吧
I take it accuracy is not your peculiarity.

1365
01:45:39,040 --> 01:45:42,350
亚伯比你强多了
Abe was a much worthier adversary.

1366
01:45:45,760 --> 01:45:47,750
别让他接近回时鸟！
Don't let him get to the birds.

1367
01:45:59,560 --> 01:46:02,230
你可得跟我介绍一下你的裁缝
You must put me in contact with your tailor.

1368
01:46:04,280 --> 01:46:07,950
回时鸟…回时鸟…我来啦！
Ymbrynes, Ymbrynes! Here I come!

1369
01:46:20,320 --> 01:46:21,380
冰冻
Cold?

1370
01:46:21,600 --> 01:46:23,950
直到血液都凝固
Wait till the blood freezes in your veins.

1371
01:46:28,640 --> 01:46:30,680
你就打算这么救你朋友？
That was your attempt to rescue your friend, was it?

1372
01:46:54,480 --> 01:46:56,670
杰克！
Jake.

1373
01:46:56,840 --> 01:46:58,170
我尽量拖住他
I'll hold him off as long as I can.

1374
01:46:58,200 --> 01:46:59,630
你什么时候才能明白
When are you going to realize

1375
01:46:59,720 --> 01:47:01,430
自己准头有多差？
you are a terrible shot with that thing.

1376
01:47:03,280 --> 01:47:05,280
带上其他人，我们在时间圈入口那里见
Get the others. I'll meet you at the loop entrance.

1377
01:47:18,480 --> 01:47:19,540
我这就救你出来
Let's get you out.

1378
01:47:48,840 --> 01:47:50,030
反正最后
Eventually...

1379
01:47:50,200 --> 01:47:52,660
你也会没气可吹
you're going to run out of breath.

1380
01:47:52,840 --> 01:47:56,030
窒息而死
And it'll all be over!

1381
01:47:56,240 --> 01:47:59,830
为你亲爱的杰克和佩小姐…
Death for your beloved Jake and Miss Peregrine...

1382
01:48:00,000 --> 01:48:03,230
还有为了我的永生而死
everlasting life for me!

1383
01:48:06,080 --> 01:48:08,350
你该吃点薄荷了
And a mint for you.

1384
01:49:02,280 --> 01:49:04,070
奥丽芙！
Olive.

1385
01:49:08,640 --> 01:49:10,270
对不起，奥丽芙
I'm so sorry, Olive.

1386
01:49:12,320 --> 01:49:14,110
这么多年我都没珍惜你
All these years, I never appreciated you.

1387
01:49:15,640 --> 01:49:17,430
我一直不知道自己有多幸运
I didn't see how lucky I was.

1388
01:49:19,760 --> 01:49:23,070
我习惯了你一直陪在我身边，从没意识到
I got so used to having you there, I never realized...

1389
01:49:31,000 --> 01:49:32,000
没意识到什么？
You never realized what?

1390
01:50:22,040 --> 01:50:24,470
找到你们的孩子们，创造新的时间圈
Find your children. Create new loops.

1391
01:50:27,880 --> 01:50:29,230
杰克
So, Jake...

1392
01:50:29,400 --> 01:50:32,710
原来是继承了你祖父的异能
I see you've inherited your grandfather's peculiarity.

1393
01:50:32,880 --> 01:50:35,150
就是像他一样讨厌
You're just as annoying as he was.

1394
01:50:38,240 --> 01:50:39,870
说到亚伯
Speaking of Abe...

1395
01:50:40,360 --> 01:50:42,820
记得你死后要是看见他
if you should see him in the afterlife...

1396
01:50:43,560 --> 01:50:45,190
替我问候他
give him my regards.

1397
01:50:53,720 --> 01:50:56,070
不能再让他带走你了
Please. We can't risk him taking you again.

1398
01:51:15,120 --> 01:51:16,750
伊诺克！其他人呢？
Enoch! Where are the others?

1399
01:51:16,920 --> 01:51:18,850
他们都很安全，奥丽芙正带他们回船上
They're safe. Olive is leading them back to the Ghost Train.

1400
01:51:18,880 --> 01:51:20,750
杰克需要我们，巴伦太强了
Jake needs us. Barron's too strong.

1401
01:51:28,440 --> 01:51:29,910
你现在没了佩小姐
You've lost Miss Peregrine.

1402
01:51:30,280 --> 01:51:32,470
你什么都没了！结束了！
You've lost everything. It's over.

1403
01:51:46,000 --> 01:51:47,110
杰克？
Jake?

1404
01:51:51,400 --> 01:51:52,620
杰克？
Jake?

1405
01:51:56,480 --> 01:51:57,750
杰克？
Jake?

1406
01:52:04,440 --> 01:52:05,630
艾玛？
Emma?

1407
01:52:05,800 --> 01:52:07,710
等一下，那不是我，那是巴伦
No, wait. Look. That's not me. It's Barron.

1408
01:52:07,800 --> 01:52:08,800
别听他的
Don't listen to him.

1409
01:52:08,920 --> 01:52:10,060
他才是巴伦，我是杰克
He's Barron. No, I'm Jake.

1410
01:52:10,200 --> 01:52:11,310
他是巴伦
That's Barron.

1411
01:52:11,960 --> 01:52:13,470
我比杰克准的多
I've got a better shot than Jake.

1412
01:52:13,640 --> 01:52:15,320
你俩最好都给我别动
So, neither of you move until we sort this.

1413
01:52:15,480 --> 01:52:16,830
听着，我是杰克
Listen to me. I'm Jake.

1414
01:52:17,040 --> 01:52:19,750
我家在佛罗里达，梦想成为探险家
I grew up in Florida and I wanted to be an explorer.

1415
01:52:19,960 --> 01:52:22,280
我认为一切都不会改变，因为我很普通
I thought nothing would ever change because I was ordinary.

1416
01:52:22,640 --> 01:52:24,190
他是杰克，那是巴伦
That's Jake. Get Barron.

1417
01:52:24,360 --> 01:52:25,570
等一下！他是我心理医生
No. Look. I told him all of this.

1418
01:52:25,600 --> 01:52:26,870
这些都是我告诉他的
She was my psychiatrist.

1419
01:52:27,480 --> 01:52:29,670
你们来对付他，我去找佩小姐
Look, you deal with him. I'll go find Miss Peregrine.

1420
01:52:38,160 --> 01:52:39,160
等一下
Wait.

1421
01:52:40,320 --> 01:52:42,310
我可以证明自己
Look, I can prove that I'm me...

1422
01:52:43,200 --> 01:52:45,030
因为我并不普通
because I'm not ordinary.

1423
01:52:47,560 --> 01:52:49,830
我能做的事情别人不行
I can do something no one else can

1424
01:52:58,400 --> 01:53:00,670
我能看到那怪物
I can see the monsters.

1425
01:53:08,520 --> 01:53:09,990
看看，是我！
No, wait. It's me!

1426
01:53:27,240 --> 01:53:28,270
伊诺克！
Enoch!

1427
01:53:44,240 --> 01:53:46,750
我们得走了，时间圈要关了
We need to go. The loop is closing.

1428
01:53:49,920 --> 01:53:51,110
我们要走了
Those of us who are leaving.

1429
01:54:57,320 --> 01:54:58,320
艾玛…
Emma.

1430
01:54:58,440 --> 01:54:59,630
你爱你祖父
You love your grandfather.

1431
01:55:00,080 --> 01:55:01,630
其他的就不用多说了
There's nothing more to explain.

1432
01:55:02,080 --> 01:55:05,270
不，我答应了佩小姐照顾你们
No, I promised Miss Peregrine I'd look after you all.

1433
01:55:05,440 --> 01:55:07,590
现在她受伤了，你们也不在时间圈里
And with her injured, and you without a loop...

1434
01:55:07,760 --> 01:55:09,030
她会康复的
She'll recover.

1435
01:55:09,840 --> 01:55:12,950
到那之前，我们继续生活在1943年
Until then, we'll be in 1943.

1436
01:55:13,440 --> 01:55:15,900
只是像普通人一样
We'll only age one day at a time.

1437
01:55:16,080 --> 01:55:17,300
经历时间而已
Like normal people.

1438
01:55:18,120 --> 01:55:19,430
这也不是什么坏事
Which can be no bad thing.

1439
01:55:19,640 --> 01:55:21,670
那空灵怎么办？
What about the Hollows?

1440
01:55:21,840 --> 01:55:24,270
只要他们还在，你们就不安全
As long as they're out there, you're not safe.

1441
01:55:25,360 --> 01:55:28,030
杰克，没有你我们也能安全
We don't need you to make us feel safe, Jake.

1442
01:55:28,720 --> 01:55:31,510
因为你已经教给我们更好的
Because you made us feel brave.

1443
01:55:32,000 --> 01:55:33,470
你让我们勇敢
And that's even better.

1444
01:56:36,440 --> 01:56:38,870
伙伴们，走吧！
Come on, guys. Let's go.

1445
01:57:13,280 --> 01:57:14,500
小老虎
Tygrysku.

1446
01:57:22,080 --> 01:57:24,510
之后我们就道别了
And then we said goodbye...

1447
01:57:25,200 --> 01:57:27,070
时间圈关闭了
and the loop closed.

1448
01:57:28,360 --> 01:57:31,150
我害怕你不在这儿了
I was so scared that you wouldn't be here.

1449
01:57:32,960 --> 01:57:34,830
我就再也见不到你了
That I'd never see you again.

1450
01:57:35,760 --> 01:57:37,310
我很好
I'm safe.

1451
01:57:40,640 --> 01:57:43,430
我要送你生日礼物
Let me give you your birthday present.

1452
01:57:44,480 --> 01:57:46,400
爷爷，我的生日还有好几个月呢
Grandpa, my birthday isn't for months.

1453
01:57:51,320 --> 01:57:53,310
这是你的路费
For your travels.

1454
01:57:54,480 --> 01:57:56,030
杰克，去找她吧
Go to her, Jake.

1455
01:57:57,640 --> 01:57:59,310
你有地图
You have the map.

1456
01:57:59,480 --> 01:58:02,470
你能回到1943年
You can get back to 1943.

1457
01:58:05,000 --> 01:58:07,630
但他们在船上
No. Even so, they took a boat.

1458
01:58:07,800 --> 01:58:09,550
我不知道他们现在在哪儿
I don't know where they are.

1459
01:58:11,680 --> 01:58:14,140
但你知道他们曾经在哪儿
But you know where they were.

1460
01:58:53,040 --> 01:58:56,870
你是不知道我怎么过来的
You have no idea how long it took me to get here.

1461
01:58:59,000 --> 01:59:01,030
最近的时间圈在加利福尼亚沙漠
The closest loop was in the California desert.

1462
01:59:10,000 --> 01:59:12,270
我从那里去了东京的时间圈
I used it to get to the Tokyo loop.

1463
01:59:16,560 --> 01:59:19,910
然后又去了离这儿最近的1942年时间圈
And that led me to the nearest loop back in 1942...

1464
01:59:20,080 --> 01:59:22,190
我参加了海军还受伤了
where I wound up joining the Navy.

1465
01:59:22,360 --> 01:59:23,870
这就别多问了
Don't ask.

1466
01:59:24,040 --> 01:59:25,950
之后我在伦敦待了两个月想要…
Then I spent two months in London trying to...

1467
01:59:53,280 --> 01:59:56,230
准备好，加速前进！
Ready for full speed ahead!
