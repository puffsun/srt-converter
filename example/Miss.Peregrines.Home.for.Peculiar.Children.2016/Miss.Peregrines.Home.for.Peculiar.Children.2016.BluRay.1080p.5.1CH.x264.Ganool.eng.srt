1
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:01,710
Do you ever feel like nothing you do matters?

2
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,430
You leave footprints on the beach,

3
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:05,830
and tomorrow they're gone.

4
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:08,710
Like it's just today over again.

5
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:12,460
They say your teen years

6
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:14,860
are for making friends and having fun...

7
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:17,420
which made me feel even worse.

8
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:20,270
Hey, Amy. It's Jake.

9
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:21,990
I'm in your math class.

10
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:24,400
Hey, don't forget your adult diapers.

11
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:25,480
Yeah, right.

12
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,790
Jake. Phone for you.

13
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:38,870
But that day, everything changed.

14
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:43,630
Thanks for the ride, Shelley.

15
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:46,980
So, how come you have to go deal with your grandpa?

16
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:49,550
My dad couldn't get out of work.

17
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:51,790
I didn't think he worked.

18
00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:59,110
I'm just gonna call Grandpa.

19
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:03,030
Hello, this is Abe.

20
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:04,670
Hey, it's Jake.

21
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:08,070
No! Don't come here. Listen to me.

22
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:09,910
It's not safe.

23
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:11,110
Stay away.

24
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:13,630
Grandpa, did you take your pills today?

25
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:17,500
The key to my gun cabinet, it was in the drawer.

26
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:18,990
And now it's gone.

27
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:22,350
Yeah, Dad took it, all right?

28
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:25,630
For safekeeping. It's okay.

29
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:28,370
Your father wants I should fight them without a gun?

30
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:35,590
God bless him.

31
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:38,150
What's his deal, Alzheimer's?

32
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:39,990
Dementia.

33
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:02,950
That guy gave me the heebie-jeebies.

34
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:14,590
Holler if you need me.

35
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:23,900
Grandpa?

36
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:49,360
Shelley!

37
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:56,280
What's goin' on?

38
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:57,860
Someone broke in.

39
00:05:58,200 --> 00:06:00,580
I've got a.38 in my car. You wait there.

40
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:50,700
Grandpa!

41
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:05,290
911. What's your emergency?

42
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:07,510
911? Yeah, I need the paramedics.

43
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:09,980
It's at 2040 Palm Circle. My grandpa...

44
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:12,370
Sir, what's your emergency?

45
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:13,400
Grandpa.

46
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:15,470
You have to get away from here.

47
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:16,920
Sir, can you hear me?

48
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:18,790
Please. Listen.

49
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,670
Go to the island.

50
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:22,630
Sir, paramedics are on their way.

51
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:24,910
Find Emerson.

52
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:27,830
The postcard.

53
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,510
Go to the loop.

54
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:32,390
September 3rd, 1943.

55
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:34,100
It's okay.

56
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:36,190
Just don't move. There's an ambulance coming.

57
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:39,270
I know you think I'm crazy.

58
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:42,470
But the bird will explain everything.

59
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:46,710
Will you do this, Tygrysku? Promise me?

60
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:48,310
I promise, yes.

61
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:50,910
I thought I could protect you.

62
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:57,150
I should have told you years ago.

63
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:06,310
Grandpa. Tell me what?

64
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:07,900
Grandpa!

65
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:30,070
Shelley, behind you!

66
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:47,190
There was no one there.

67
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:49,950
May I say, Jake...

68
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:52,270
that considering this was only a month ago...

69
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:54,900
I think you're doing exceptionally well.

70
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:57,780
Apart from being crazy?

71
00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:02,220
Having nightmares and anxiety doesn't make you crazy.

72
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:05,910
What about seeing things which aren't there?

73
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:07,170
Actually, in traumatic situations,

74
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:08,420
it's not at all uncommon.

75
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:12,190
Your subconscious mind drew an image from a movie or...

76
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:13,830
It was a story.

77
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:17,580
My grandpa told me stories when I was a kid...

78
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:20,470
about monsters that he fought in the war.

79
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:21,640
So there you go.

80
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:23,510
He was brutally attacked...

81
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:26,990
and in your head, the man who did it was inhuman, a monster.

82
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:29,430
It wasn't a man, though.

83
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:31,910
The cops said that dogs

84
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,190
scratched up the screen door...

85
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:37,310
and he chased them off into the woods.

86
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:39,670
And the coroner said he had a heart attack.

87
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:41,830
And the cops said...

88
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:46,870
that dogs go for the soft parts.

89
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:49,550
They DNA tested the fork...

90
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:52,550
and it had animal DNA.

91
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:54,990
So, that's case closed.

92
00:09:56,120 --> 00:09:58,830
He sounds like an extraordinary gentleman.

93
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:01,270
Were you very close?

94
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:02,920
Puerto Rico.

95
00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:05,280
Here.

96
00:10:05,560 --> 00:10:08,430
There's a lake where the water glows in the dark.

97
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:10,510
And a secret tunnel.

98
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:12,980
That's where I hid from the monsters.

99
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:15,350
He used to babysit me a lot.

100
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:17,790
When I was with him, I felt special.

101
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:21,110
My duck was dry again.

102
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:25,670
Abe. It's, like, 11:00. What is he doing up?

103
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,630
I'm gonna be an explorer.

104
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:31,630
Grandpa's helping me plan my first voyage.

105
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:33,950
Everything's already been discovered, buddy.

106
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:37,250
They terrorize each other...

107
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:39,950
before wreaking havoc on the rest of the island.

108
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:41,400
Pay no attention to your father.

109
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:42,500
He knows bubkes.

110
00:10:42,680 --> 00:10:46,030
Come, Tygrysku. Off to bed.

111
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:56,910
Can you tell me a story?

112
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,000
The usual?

113
00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:02,790
Okay. Once upon a time...

114
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:04,230
there was a little boy...

115
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:05,790
With the pictures.

116
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:07,580
Pictures.

117
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:17,030
Once upon a time...

118
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:19,830
there was a little boy called Abe.

119
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,310
That was you.

120
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:22,760
That was me.

121
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:26,150
And he lived in a lovely children's home

122
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:27,870
on a little island near Wales...

123
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:30,230
where the sun shone every day.

124
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:34,190
The headmistress, Miss Peregrine...

125
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:36,230
was very clever.

126
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:38,860
And she smoked a pipe.

127
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:40,180
She could turn into a bird.

128
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:45,670
It was a home for special children...

129
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:49,070
like Bronwyn and Victor.

130
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:52,790
They were both as strong as 10 men.

131
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:54,740
And Hugh...

132
00:11:54,920 --> 00:11:58,310
Hugh had bees living inside him.

133
00:11:59,640 --> 00:12:00,640
Where's Emma?

134
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:02,550
She could float.

135
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:06,630
She was lighter than air.

136
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:10,030
She had to wear special shoes made of lead

137
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:11,950
to keep her from floating away.

138
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:14,710
Where is she now?

139
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:17,380
She's still on the island, I believe.

140
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:20,470
My mama and papa sent me there...

141
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:22,910
to live with the special children.

142
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:26,430
And now, Tygrysku, time for sleep.

143
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:28,430
He used to call me Tygrysku.

144
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:30,510
It's Polish for "little tiger."

145
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,190
He couldn't have picked a less appropriate nickname.

146
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:34,750
I was always a chicken.

147
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:37,590
Why did your mom and dad send you away?

148
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:42,340
Well, where we lived in Poland, it wasn't safe.

149
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:44,310
There were monsters.

150
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:46,750
What kind of monsters?

151
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:50,700
Huge ones, with long arms...

152
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:52,790
and no eyes...

153
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,560
and tentacles like this.

154
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:00,510
The dumb thing was...

155
00:13:00,680 --> 00:13:02,830
for years, I actually believed his stories.

156
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:06,590
And this is Millard. He's invisible.

157
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:16,870
My teacher says they were trick photos.

158
00:13:17,640 --> 00:13:19,150
And did you believe her?

159
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:21,310
Dad says you probably found them

160
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:22,670
at a junk store someplace...

161
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:25,220
when you went traveling.

162
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:27,860
I would never lie to you, Tygrysku.

163
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:33,470
But you did, about the home, the monsters.

164
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:36,110
Dad told me.

165
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:38,590
Your father knows very well

166
00:13:38,680 --> 00:13:40,870
I went to live in the children's home.

167
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:44,990
He said there really were monsters in Poland...

168
00:13:45,280 --> 00:13:48,270
just not the kind with tentacles.

169
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:52,150
He said you got sent to Wales 'cause there were bad people.

170
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:56,590
People who wanted to kill anyone who was different.

171
00:13:57,600 --> 00:13:59,710
I don't wanna talk about this anymore.

172
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:02,670
He said the children were special...

173
00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:06,600
but not the way you said.

174
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:46,260
You find something good?

175
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:51,150
Oh, look at that. That's awesome.

176
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:53,350
You should take that.

177
00:14:53,520 --> 00:14:55,390
Come on, buddy, let's roll.

178
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:58,830
How are you so okay?

179
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:02,870
Jakey, you were a lot closer to him than I ever was.

180
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:04,870
He was a wonderful grandpa...

181
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:06,870
but not such a great dad.

182
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:10,420
Never seemed to pick a job...

183
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:11,910
that didn't involve late nights

184
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,670
or long trips away, though.

185
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:16,310
Me and Aunt Susie always kind of thought

186
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:19,230
he was, maybe, cheating on our mom.

187
00:15:21,560 --> 00:15:23,680
I'm sorry, buddy. I know how much you worshiped him...

188
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:25,470
but there it is.

189
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:35,790
Surprise!

190
00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:37,100
Happy birthday, Cousin Jake!

191
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:39,010
J-dog, it's great you're coming

192
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:40,080
to spend a summer with us.

193
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:41,430
Wait till you see the new boat.

194
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:43,360
Can't wait.

195
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:54,790
It's Aunt Susie.

196
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:57,670
Thought you might wanna open this one.

197
00:15:57,840 --> 00:15:59,990
It's from your grandpa.

198
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:02,310
Found it while I was packing up.

199
00:16:02,520 --> 00:16:05,080
I figured he meant to give it to you someday.

200
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:08,460
Thanks.

201
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:30,630
To Jake, and the worlds he has yet to discover.

202
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:43,630
My dearest Abe...

203
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:45,870
I hope this card finds you well.

204
00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:49,070
The children and I yearn to hear your news.

205
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:51,590
I do hope you will visit us again soon.

206
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:53,550
We should so love to see you.

207
00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:55,070
With admiration...

208
00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:56,420
Alma Peregrine.

209
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:58,910
H mm. Only two years ago.

210
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:02,070
I suppose it's possible she could still be alive.

211
00:17:02,640 --> 00:17:03,780
Right.

212
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:06,510
I could meet her.

213
00:17:06,680 --> 00:17:08,110
Maybe even find out what it was

214
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:09,590
Grandpa wanted me to know.

215
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:11,070
But what if she's dead?

216
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:12,240
Dr. Golan...

217
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:13,590
we are very concerned

218
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:15,470
with Jake's state of mind right now.

219
00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:17,010
There's no way I'm putting my life on hold

220
00:17:17,040 --> 00:17:18,100
to take you to Wales.

221
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:20,910
Dad could take me.

222
00:17:21,080 --> 00:17:23,670
And he can look at birds...

223
00:17:23,840 --> 00:17:24,980
and work on his book.

224
00:17:25,440 --> 00:17:27,670
It means you get a break.

225
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:29,190
As Dr. Golan said...

226
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:31,590
maybe I can move on.

227
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:33,700
Like, closure.

228
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:37,390
Having an opportunity to see this children's home...

229
00:17:37,560 --> 00:17:39,670
and separate fantasy from reality...

230
00:17:40,280 --> 00:17:41,630
may be helpful.

231
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:43,150
And at the very least...

232
00:17:43,320 --> 00:17:45,880
a trip like this provides a chance to...

233
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:48,190
say goodbye.

234
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:57,110
"Cairnholm. Population of 92.

235
00:17:57,680 --> 00:17:59,550
"Best known for its proximity...

236
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:02,710
"to the final resting place of the cruise liner Augusta...

237
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:05,230
"which sank in 1915.

238
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:07,710
"There is just one hotel..."

239
00:18:08,360 --> 00:18:09,420
That's us.

240
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:11,470
Yeah. I hope there's bourbon.

241
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:17,390
Jake, check it out.

242
00:18:17,560 --> 00:18:19,670
That's a peregrine falcon.

243
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:22,300
A peregrine, like the headmistress?

244
00:18:23,080 --> 00:18:24,390
Sure.

245
00:18:24,560 --> 00:18:26,190
That's probably where Grandpa came up

246
00:18:26,280 --> 00:18:28,030
with that whole turning into a bird thing.

247
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:31,670
Or maybe, maybe that's really her!

248
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:33,350
Hey, Miss Peregrine.

249
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:34,910
It's me, Jake.

250
00:18:35,080 --> 00:18:37,270
I'm Abe Portman's grandson.

251
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:39,590
Please don't crap on us.

252
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:44,060
Oh, my God. Dad, I'm kidding.

253
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:13,430
What the... Hello?

254
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:15,580
Hello?

255
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:21,790
Anybody home?

256
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,000
Oh, hey.

257
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:36,430
Any idea where I'd find the manager of this place?

258
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:38,630
That's me. Sorry to keep you.

259
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:40,670
Just helping Uncle Oggie to the loo.

260
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:43,830
I'm Kev. There's room upstairs.

261
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,000
Oh, great.

262
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:46,190
I'll be back in a bit.

263
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:50,150
Kev's just getting our suite ready.

264
00:19:51,160 --> 00:19:52,510
Um, while we're waiting...

265
00:19:52,680 --> 00:19:55,270
I thought maybe we could go check out the beach.

266
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:57,350
I thought we would go to the children's home.

267
00:19:57,520 --> 00:19:59,790
Is the beach where the birds nest?

268
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:02,340
I thought we could just check it out real quick.

269
00:20:02,520 --> 00:20:05,110
I could go to the home by myself.

270
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:08,900
Then, you can really take your time and enjoy it.

271
00:20:09,080 --> 00:20:11,510
Come on, Jakey. You know your mom would freak.

272
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:14,900
What if we can find someone to take me?

273
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:17,860
Hey, dudes.

274
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:19,910
- Dad. Don't.
- Shh! I got this.

275
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:21,720
I was just wondering if any of you guys...

276
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:23,210
might be interested in taking my son here

277
00:20:23,240 --> 00:20:25,310
to the other side of the island.

278
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:41,470
So, what are your names?

279
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:43,630
I'm Worm. This is MC Dirty D.

280
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:45,030
MC Dirty Bizniz.

281
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:46,230
I thought you changed it.

282
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:47,320
No.

283
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:48,670
No, you did, remember?

284
00:20:48,840 --> 00:20:50,190
When Ruth said "MC Dirty Bizniz"

285
00:20:50,280 --> 00:20:52,000
made it sound like you cacked your trousers.

286
00:20:52,160 --> 00:20:54,030
Yeah, but she said "Dirty D" sounded like

287
00:20:54,120 --> 00:20:55,180
a personal hygiene problem.

288
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:57,990
Wait. Are these, like, nicknames, or...

289
00:20:58,160 --> 00:21:00,950
Stage names. We're the sickest rappers in Wales.

290
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:03,310
Go on, Worm. Show this Yank how it's done.

291
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:04,480
What? Now?

292
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:07,320
I like to get wrecked down the Priest Hole

293
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:09,240
Your dad's always here 'cause he's on the dole

294
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:11,230
Our rhymes are tight Yet I make it look easy

295
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:13,470
Our beats are hot like chicken jalfrezi

296
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:17,510
Oh, yeah, no. It's good.

297
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:20,230
Should we take the shortcut, D?

298
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:22,510
We'll get there quicker. Take it from me.

299
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:24,990
What, down here?

300
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:33,320
Go.

301
00:21:40,680 --> 00:21:41,870
This way?

302
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:46,520
What the...

303
00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:54,150
Is this even the way to the children's home?

304
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:55,990
Right through those trees.

305
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:27,430
No use crying over a lost shoe, boy-o.

306
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:34,110
The children's home. What happened to it?

307
00:22:34,280 --> 00:22:37,980
A German air raid. Bomb fell right on the roof.

308
00:22:38,160 --> 00:22:41,230
September the 3rd, 1943.

309
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:43,350
Where did they go after?

310
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:45,510
The headmistress and the children.

311
00:22:46,160 --> 00:22:49,110
Not one survivor. Poor little buggers.

312
00:22:50,040 --> 00:22:52,470
And they were lovely, too.

313
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:56,630
Why didn't he tell us that they all died?

314
00:22:56,800 --> 00:22:58,640
He leaves to join the army, and 3 months later,

315
00:22:58,680 --> 00:23:00,870
everyone he knows gets killed?

316
00:23:01,800 --> 00:23:04,950
Not even Grandpa could turn that into a bedtime story.

317
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:08,870
Well, no wonder he was scared of being a dad...

318
00:23:09,040 --> 00:23:10,670
being close to anyone.

319
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:13,780
Listen.

320
00:23:14,920 --> 00:23:17,110
You need to talk about all this with someone, buddy.

321
00:23:18,120 --> 00:23:19,870
We should call Dr. Golan.

322
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:26,150
Certainly some enjoyment today.

323
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:30,730
Er, do you mind if I go hang out

324
00:23:30,760 --> 00:23:32,150
with those other kids today?

325
00:23:32,520 --> 00:23:33,520
They asked.

326
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:36,230
Yeah? That's awesome.

327
00:25:11,480 --> 00:25:12,510
Abe?

328
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:26,390
No!

329
00:26:01,920 --> 00:26:02,920
You're Emma!

330
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:05,470
And the twins.

331
00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:06,830
And Olive.

332
00:26:07,560 --> 00:26:08,910
And Bronwyn.

333
00:26:09,880 --> 00:26:10,880
And he's Millard.

334
00:26:12,560 --> 00:26:13,590
No, you're dead.

335
00:26:14,120 --> 00:26:15,750
All of you, you're all dead.

336
00:26:15,920 --> 00:26:18,670
He's invisible, but he's still dead.

337
00:26:19,080 --> 00:26:20,140
None of us are dead.

338
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:23,870
Oh, my God. Am I dead?

339
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:25,320
No.

340
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:29,550
You called me Abe.

341
00:26:30,040 --> 00:26:31,990
In the house. Why?

342
00:26:32,160 --> 00:26:33,220
You looked like him.

343
00:26:33,880 --> 00:26:34,880
Just for a moment,

344
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:37,030
before you started screaming...

345
00:26:37,240 --> 00:26:39,070
running away, and concussing yourself.

346
00:26:39,280 --> 00:26:40,710
Wait. What's happening?

347
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:42,330
We're waiting until the coast is clear...

348
00:26:42,360 --> 00:26:43,750
before we go into the loop.

349
00:26:45,040 --> 00:26:47,670
You never know who might be watching.

350
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:50,350
Wait. Before we go into what?

351
00:26:50,520 --> 00:26:51,520
Please, Jake.

352
00:26:51,680 --> 00:26:54,030
Miss Peregrine's waiting. She saw you on the ferry.

353
00:26:54,200 --> 00:26:55,310
She sent us to get you.

354
00:27:45,880 --> 00:27:46,880
Hey!

355
00:27:48,120 --> 00:27:49,630
Where do you think you're going?

356
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:51,830
To my room.

357
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:55,350
I'm a guest here.

358
00:27:55,800 --> 00:27:58,990
Does this look like a hotel to you?

359
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:02,070
Yeah.

360
00:28:02,280 --> 00:28:04,630
No. I've got a key.

361
00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:07,790
Talk to the manager. He'll tell you.

362
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:09,700
I'm the manager, boy.

363
00:28:10,680 --> 00:28:12,350
He's American. Maybe he's army?

364
00:28:13,640 --> 00:28:14,670
Bollocks.

365
00:28:14,760 --> 00:28:16,590
Listen to his accent. It's terrible.

366
00:28:17,800 --> 00:28:19,590
He's a spy.

367
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:21,910
What?

368
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,270
No, I'm not. I'm a tourist.

369
00:28:24,440 --> 00:28:26,790
I say we should get the truth out of him

370
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:28,630
the old-fashioned way.

371
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:50,790
Come on!

372
00:28:59,480 --> 00:29:00,670
Jake, get on!

373
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:05,070
Come on! Get on, boy!

374
00:29:15,280 --> 00:29:18,070
I can't believe you're real. You're all real!

375
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:19,790
We have been trying to tell you.

376
00:29:19,960 --> 00:29:21,180
But I'm special, too.

377
00:29:21,320 --> 00:29:22,350
What?

378
00:29:22,440 --> 00:29:23,990
in the pub. Olive, you saw.

379
00:29:24,160 --> 00:29:27,270
Right? Everything was flying and breaking.

380
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:28,440
And that was me!

381
00:29:28,840 --> 00:29:30,870
I was doing it with my mind.

382
00:29:31,080 --> 00:29:32,910
No, that was me.

383
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:35,200
Millard?

384
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:36,900
Yeah.

385
00:29:37,960 --> 00:29:39,180
Are you naked?

386
00:29:39,280 --> 00:29:40,310
Yeah.

387
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:43,640
Oh.

388
00:29:44,920 --> 00:29:45,950
I don't...

389
00:29:46,680 --> 00:29:49,110
A bomb dropped on you in 1943.

390
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:51,630
It is 1943.

391
00:29:51,800 --> 00:29:54,470
September the 3rd, 1943.

392
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:56,350
All day, every day.

393
00:29:56,560 --> 00:29:57,670
It's our loop.

394
00:30:30,560 --> 00:30:31,780
Right on time.

395
00:30:33,040 --> 00:30:34,950
Miss Peregrine. Delighted to meet you.

396
00:30:36,040 --> 00:30:37,950
I do hope I'm not going to have the pub landlord

397
00:30:38,040 --> 00:30:39,910
knocking on my door with the police again.

398
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:41,670
I've had to kill them twice this month.

399
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:43,590
It's been terribly inconvenient.

400
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:45,870
Millard broke a few things. That's all.

401
00:30:46,040 --> 00:30:49,550
And Olive may have started a tiny fire.

402
00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:53,590
But they were going to hurt Jake.

403
00:30:57,200 --> 00:30:58,950
Look at you.

404
00:30:59,120 --> 00:31:00,920
The last time dear Abe sent me a photograph...

405
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:02,950
you were just a tiny tot.

406
00:31:03,400 --> 00:31:04,710
Don't just stand there. Come in.

407
00:31:04,840 --> 00:31:06,270
Your tea's getting cold.

408
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:10,830
How did you know about the pub?

409
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:13,030
You weigh approximately 109 pounds, correct?

410
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:14,150
I don't...

411
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:16,600
Bronwyn and the twins returned 6 minutes after you ran away.

412
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:18,030
I think I'm missing something.

413
00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:19,290
And quite apart from the fact

414
00:31:19,320 --> 00:31:20,610
that the perceived safety of the pub...

415
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:22,730
makes it the most likely place to which you would flee...

416
00:31:22,760 --> 00:31:24,590
it would take you 18 minutes to run there.

417
00:31:24,760 --> 00:31:26,720
Emma and Millard would have been moments behind...

418
00:31:26,800 --> 00:31:27,860
on the horse and trap,

419
00:31:27,960 --> 00:31:29,670
traveling at 8.2 miles per hour.

420
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:31,910
Factoring in some sort of kerfuffle at the pub...

421
00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:34,190
and the return journey with your added weight...

422
00:31:34,360 --> 00:31:37,310
you would arrive here at 13 minutes past 4.

423
00:31:38,200 --> 00:31:40,500
Now, then, do you take sugar?

424
00:31:41,160 --> 00:31:42,730
That'll do. Thank you, Olive.

425
00:31:42,760 --> 00:31:45,190
Nobody enjoys over-boiled tea.

426
00:31:55,160 --> 00:31:57,350
Let me help you with those, Enoch.

427
00:31:57,560 --> 00:32:00,120
Don't bother. Wouldn't want to interrupt your tea party.

428
00:32:10,280 --> 00:32:12,310
I'm so sorry for your loss, Jake.

429
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:16,030
You know, then.

430
00:32:17,400 --> 00:32:18,910
I know if Abe were alive,

431
00:32:19,040 --> 00:32:20,670
he would have told me you were coming.

432
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:26,070
Shall we take our tea outside?

433
00:32:27,280 --> 00:32:28,280
Thank you.

434
00:32:30,680 --> 00:32:33,470
Before he died, he told me to find you.

435
00:32:33,680 --> 00:32:35,310
There was something he wanted me to know.

436
00:32:35,480 --> 00:32:37,030
He said you could explain everything.

437
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:38,550
That's absolutely true.

438
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:41,020
There are very few things I can't explain.

439
00:32:42,160 --> 00:32:44,870
We're what's known, in common parlance,

440
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:46,710
as "peculiar."

441
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:50,310
51 seconds late, Fiona.

442
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:52,020
Sorry, Miss Peregrine.

443
00:32:52,120 --> 00:32:53,680
How many carrots do you need for supper?

444
00:32:54,120 --> 00:32:56,190
Just one will do.

445
00:33:10,520 --> 00:33:13,750
As I was saying, some people are peculiar.

446
00:33:13,920 --> 00:33:16,910
It's a recessive gene carried down through families.

447
00:33:17,080 --> 00:33:19,070
Yet, many generations can pass

448
00:33:19,160 --> 00:33:21,540
without a peculiar child being born.

449
00:33:22,760 --> 00:33:26,910
And alas, peculiars have been persecuted through the ages.

450
00:33:27,080 --> 00:33:29,190
Hence, we live in places like this.

451
00:33:30,200 --> 00:33:31,200
In Wales?

452
00:33:31,400 --> 00:33:33,350
Anywhere will do if you pick the right day.

453
00:33:33,520 --> 00:33:35,070
That's fine now, Fiona.

454
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:42,750
You see, I'm a type of peculiar called an Ymbryne.

455
00:33:42,920 --> 00:33:44,270
That means I can...

456
00:33:44,440 --> 00:33:45,660
Yeah, you turn into a bird.

457
00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:47,550
I do. Yes.

458
00:33:47,720 --> 00:33:49,430
But that's not very useful.

459
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:52,550
An Ymbryne's main skill is the manipulation of time.

460
00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:54,790
We choose a safe place, a safe day...

461
00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:57,070
and create a loop.

462
00:33:57,880 --> 00:33:59,270
What do you mean?

463
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:02,790
A loop preserves the last 24 hours.

464
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:05,630
Reset the loop, and the day is yours to live in again.

465
00:34:06,440 --> 00:34:07,550
Reset it daily...

466
00:34:07,720 --> 00:34:09,630
and you can stay there forever.

467
00:34:09,800 --> 00:34:11,870
Entirely safe from the outside world.

468
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:14,550
Right on time, Bronwyn. Good girl.

469
00:34:20,400 --> 00:34:21,950
And that's why we Ymbrynes

470
00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:23,630
are charged with the care of the young.

471
00:34:27,080 --> 00:34:29,310
And no one ever gets older.

472
00:34:30,160 --> 00:34:32,070
It's best for everyone this way.

473
00:34:32,160 --> 00:34:33,470
I assure you.

474
00:34:37,320 --> 00:34:38,950
Every Ymbryne commits herself...

475
00:34:39,120 --> 00:34:41,270
to the creation and upkeep of a place like this.

476
00:34:42,280 --> 00:34:44,950
A home for peculiar children.

477
00:34:57,800 --> 00:34:59,270
You met the twins.

478
00:35:05,320 --> 00:35:06,510
This is Claire.

479
00:35:18,360 --> 00:35:20,030
Millard you met.

480
00:35:22,520 --> 00:35:23,830
And that's Hugh.

481
00:35:28,200 --> 00:35:29,870
Stop cheating, Hugh.

482
00:35:30,640 --> 00:35:32,870
Millard, that's a foul again.

483
00:35:34,200 --> 00:35:36,310
No, it wasn't. Ref?

484
00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:38,710
If you two can't play soccer without squabbling...

485
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:40,390
I do wish you wouldn't play at all.

486
00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:41,720
Do you know what a referee is?

487
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:44,630
Good afternoon. I'm Horace.

488
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:45,800
Delighted to meet you.

489
00:35:48,360 --> 00:35:49,870
We sorely need some new blood here.

490
00:35:51,240 --> 00:35:52,300
Super shirt, by the way.

491
00:35:53,640 --> 00:35:54,640
Thanks.

492
00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:00,910
You know Emma, of course.

493
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:03,750
And I think that's everyone.

494
00:36:04,360 --> 00:36:06,660
Didn't Bronwyn have a brother?

495
00:36:07,560 --> 00:36:09,590
Yes. Victor's upstairs.

496
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:11,120
Wait, where did Enoch and Olive go?

497
00:36:11,880 --> 00:36:13,020
Heaven knows.

498
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:15,560
Enoch's been off sulking ever since we went out to get Jake.

499
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:17,170
Miss Peregrine, there's a policeman at the door.

500
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:18,590
He says it's about the pub!

501
00:36:21,080 --> 00:36:22,750
We'll discuss this later, Emma.

502
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:26,870
It wasn't their fault.

503
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:30,270
Honestly, they were just trying to help.

504
00:36:40,240 --> 00:36:41,430
Thanks.

505
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:43,430
You're not as wet as I thought.

506
00:36:46,440 --> 00:36:50,030
She's not really gonna kill anyone, is she?

507
00:36:50,200 --> 00:36:52,270
Not if she can talk her way out of it.

508
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:54,110
Would you help me with something?

509
00:36:54,280 --> 00:36:55,950
Enoch usually does it, but like I said,

510
00:36:56,080 --> 00:36:57,390
he's off sulking somewhere.

511
00:36:58,640 --> 00:37:00,190
Is that because of me?

512
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:02,960
He's possessive.

513
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:07,230
So, what did you need help with?

514
00:37:08,040 --> 00:37:09,430
One of my daily chores.

515
00:37:09,600 --> 00:37:11,980
Put the baby squirrel back in the tree.

516
00:37:12,160 --> 00:37:13,300
What baby squirrel?

517
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:20,830
That happens every day?

518
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:22,270
Like clockwork.

519
00:37:23,160 --> 00:37:25,200
Now, would you mind tying that rope around my waist?

520
00:37:56,320 --> 00:37:58,430
Right. Promise to hold on tight.

521
00:38:43,240 --> 00:38:45,070
I nearly messed that up.

522
00:38:46,520 --> 00:38:49,030
Abe did, too, the first time.

523
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:50,910
This used to be his job.

524
00:38:53,200 --> 00:38:56,590
Emma, I need to tell you something.

525
00:38:57,760 --> 00:38:58,900
He's dead.

526
00:39:00,560 --> 00:39:01,700
I know.

527
00:39:01,880 --> 00:39:04,440
Miss Peregrine guessed, and she's always right.

528
00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:06,920
It's okay.

529
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:09,910
I said goodbye to him a long time ago.

530
00:39:10,680 --> 00:39:12,190
Were you close?

531
00:39:14,600 --> 00:39:16,230
I thought we were.

532
00:39:17,240 --> 00:39:18,950
For a while.

533
00:39:19,120 --> 00:39:20,750
But I suppose not.

534
00:39:23,120 --> 00:39:25,910
Can I ask, was he like you?

535
00:39:29,080 --> 00:39:30,710
He was like you, Jake.

536
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:34,830
I need to go and change for supper.

537
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:36,630
Will you be dining with us?

538
00:39:37,080 --> 00:39:38,950
I can't stay out late.

539
00:39:39,120 --> 00:39:40,750
Supper's at 5:30.

540
00:39:41,960 --> 00:39:44,110
Uh... That is pretty early.

541
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:46,390
The fact we're not all eight years old

542
00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:48,110
seems to have eluded Miss Peregrine.

543
00:39:49,240 --> 00:39:51,110
You can borrow some of Abe's clothes.

544
00:39:51,320 --> 00:39:53,310
His room's in the attic.

545
00:40:03,640 --> 00:40:04,640
Jake!

546
00:40:05,160 --> 00:40:06,550
Come and meet Enoch properly.

547
00:40:17,640 --> 00:40:19,830
You must feel pretty out of place.

548
00:40:21,680 --> 00:40:22,950
Don't worry.

549
00:40:23,520 --> 00:40:25,270
I'm used to it.

550
00:40:25,480 --> 00:40:26,620
No. I wasn't worried.

551
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:29,510
Some advice for you though, man to man.

552
00:40:29,680 --> 00:40:32,000
If you're thinking of staying just because you like Emma...

553
00:40:32,360 --> 00:40:33,360
don't bother.

554
00:40:33,520 --> 00:40:35,820
You see, she swore off romance decades ago...

555
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:37,310
when she got her heart broken.

556
00:40:38,200 --> 00:40:41,030
And she's never gonna change her mind. So...

557
00:40:44,320 --> 00:40:45,950
Enoch, I wasn't...

558
00:40:47,880 --> 00:40:48,880
What are you doing?

559
00:41:19,680 --> 00:41:20,790
Isn't he amazing?

560
00:41:21,320 --> 00:41:22,380
What did you do?

561
00:41:23,080 --> 00:41:24,470
This?

562
00:41:24,880 --> 00:41:27,150
Jake, this isn't even the fun part.

563
00:41:27,680 --> 00:41:28,920
Do you want to see the fun part?

564
00:41:53,840 --> 00:41:54,980
They're like puppets.

565
00:41:55,200 --> 00:41:57,580
Just do anything I tell them.

566
00:41:59,840 --> 00:42:01,590
It's even more fun with people.

567
00:42:01,760 --> 00:42:02,880
You should have seen some of

568
00:42:02,920 --> 00:42:04,390
the epic battles they used to have...

569
00:42:04,560 --> 00:42:05,870
at my parents' funeral parlor.

570
00:42:09,240 --> 00:42:10,430
You'll need a necktie.

571
00:42:19,720 --> 00:42:22,630
So what did my grandpa do when he was traveling?

572
00:42:23,400 --> 00:42:25,190
Visited other loops.

573
00:42:25,800 --> 00:42:28,230
Really? To do what?

574
00:42:29,120 --> 00:42:30,630
Jake, there's some questions

575
00:42:30,720 --> 00:42:32,710
that I can't answer, all right?

576
00:42:32,880 --> 00:42:34,910
So, it would be a lot easier for me if you just...

577
00:42:35,800 --> 00:42:37,110
stopped asking them.

578
00:42:56,960 --> 00:42:58,050
Hey! What are you doing?

579
00:42:58,080 --> 00:42:59,080
Millard.

580
00:42:59,240 --> 00:43:01,070
Go and put some clothes on.

581
00:43:01,240 --> 00:43:03,310
Polite persons do not take their supper in the nude.

582
00:43:03,480 --> 00:43:05,510
All right. All right.

583
00:43:08,680 --> 00:43:10,590
You can sit here, Jake.

584
00:43:12,840 --> 00:43:13,840
Look at Enoch.

585
00:43:14,600 --> 00:43:15,660
He's jealous.

586
00:43:16,120 --> 00:43:17,830
Why would I be jealous?

587
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:19,950
Olive can go marry Jake, for all I care.

588
00:43:20,120 --> 00:43:22,500
Don't be mean, Enoch. She doesn't want to.

589
00:43:22,680 --> 00:43:24,590
She's just excited to have a visitor.

590
00:43:24,760 --> 00:43:26,510
Nobody is marrying anybody.

591
00:43:26,680 --> 00:43:28,430
Now, eat up your food before it gets cold.

592
00:43:33,320 --> 00:43:34,350
Hugh!

593
00:43:35,520 --> 00:43:37,310
Where's your net?

594
00:43:37,840 --> 00:43:40,030
Hugh! You have to stop doing this, Hugh.

595
00:43:50,720 --> 00:43:52,630
Must be very strange for you, Jake.

596
00:43:53,040 --> 00:43:54,950
Meeting your grandfather's friends.

597
00:43:55,120 --> 00:43:56,710
Visiting another century.

598
00:43:56,880 --> 00:43:58,720
Are there spaceships in your time, Jake?

599
00:43:58,880 --> 00:44:00,310
Like the Flash Gordon books.

600
00:44:00,560 --> 00:44:01,560
Now, now, Olive.

601
00:44:01,720 --> 00:44:03,390
What did I say about asking questions?

602
00:44:04,240 --> 00:44:05,710
We don't discuss the future here.

603
00:44:05,880 --> 00:44:08,390
We enjoy living in the good old here and now.

604
00:44:11,680 --> 00:44:12,880
Claire, why aren't you eating?

605
00:44:14,320 --> 00:44:15,990
She's embarrassed in front of Jake.

606
00:44:16,160 --> 00:44:17,710
Don't be. Please.

607
00:44:35,600 --> 00:44:37,830
So, Jake, what's your peculiarity?

608
00:44:38,760 --> 00:44:40,590
Oh, I'm not peculiar.

609
00:44:40,760 --> 00:44:41,900
And that, my friends,

610
00:44:42,040 --> 00:44:43,830
is why he will not be staying with us...

611
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:46,430
no matter how hard we try to persuade him.

612
00:44:46,600 --> 00:44:49,190
We've spoken about this. Jake is just visiting.

613
00:44:49,360 --> 00:44:50,580
He might want to stay.

614
00:44:50,760 --> 00:44:52,510
Don't you want to stay, Jake?

615
00:44:52,960 --> 00:44:54,390
Tonight? Or...

616
00:44:54,560 --> 00:44:56,670
Forever. You should stay forever.

617
00:44:56,880 --> 00:44:59,180
Why would he, if he doesn't have to?

618
00:44:59,360 --> 00:45:01,390
He can live out there, grow older...

619
00:45:01,560 --> 00:45:03,070
have a good time instead.

620
00:45:03,240 --> 00:45:05,800
He'll leave, just like his grandfather did.

621
00:45:11,120 --> 00:45:12,120
Emma!

622
00:45:12,280 --> 00:45:13,470
Excuse me.

623
00:45:13,640 --> 00:45:14,640
Where's she going?

624
00:45:14,800 --> 00:45:15,940
That wasn't nice, Enoch.

625
00:45:16,080 --> 00:45:18,640
You know perfectly well why Abe left us.

626
00:45:18,800 --> 00:45:19,800
To join the army.

627
00:45:19,960 --> 00:45:22,470
And then he met a lady, and had a nice wedding cake...

628
00:45:22,640 --> 00:45:24,310
and a lovely little baby.

629
00:45:24,400 --> 00:45:25,400
Children.

630
00:45:27,320 --> 00:45:29,620
I know you'd all like a new friend...

631
00:45:29,800 --> 00:45:33,150
but I'm sure Jake has plenty of his own back in Florida.

632
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:37,910
I think you should all get ready

633
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:40,380
for movie time while I answer that.

634
00:45:40,560 --> 00:45:42,550
But you always let us stay for it.

635
00:46:01,640 --> 00:46:03,110
Hello, this is Abe.

636
00:46:03,800 --> 00:46:05,470
How is everyone?

637
00:46:12,360 --> 00:46:14,080
Yours has extra marshmallows, Jake.

638
00:46:14,160 --> 00:46:16,430
Millard, put some pajamas on.

639
00:46:16,600 --> 00:46:17,950
It's too hot in here.

640
00:46:18,120 --> 00:46:19,310
Stop moaning.

641
00:46:19,480 --> 00:46:20,560
Excuse me.

642
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:31,350
My grandpa told me about this.

643
00:46:31,520 --> 00:46:33,870
Horace projects his dreams, right?

644
00:46:34,040 --> 00:46:35,470
He used to listen to the radio.

645
00:46:35,640 --> 00:46:38,350
Gets tedious when you know every word off by heart.

646
00:46:42,480 --> 00:46:44,190
Splendid. I'll take it.

647
00:46:44,400 --> 00:46:45,870
He dreams about clothes mostly.

648
00:46:46,040 --> 00:46:47,230
Delighted to meet you.

649
00:46:48,880 --> 00:46:50,830
Super shirt, by the way.

650
00:46:53,400 --> 00:46:55,230
When did he dream this?

651
00:46:55,400 --> 00:46:56,670
Last night.

652
00:46:56,840 --> 00:46:58,390
Some of his dreams are prophetic.

653
00:46:58,560 --> 00:47:00,790
But, mostly they're about clothes.

654
00:47:02,080 --> 00:47:05,230
Prophetic as in, he can see into the future?

655
00:47:19,760 --> 00:47:21,430
An Ymbryne. Who is she?

656
00:47:21,600 --> 00:47:23,230
Miss Peregrine, do you know her?

657
00:47:23,440 --> 00:47:24,440
Don't be silly.

658
00:47:24,600 --> 00:47:26,750
Horace must have just had a bad dream. That's all.

659
00:48:01,480 --> 00:48:03,320
That's quite enough of that. Thank you, Horace.

660
00:48:03,920 --> 00:48:05,590
I should probably get going.

661
00:48:06,480 --> 00:48:08,860
You could stay the night, if you wanted to.

662
00:48:09,040 --> 00:48:10,950
Rather than walk home alone in the dark.

663
00:48:11,120 --> 00:48:14,310
But the island is very safe, isn't it?

664
00:48:14,480 --> 00:48:15,700
Of course!

665
00:48:15,880 --> 00:48:18,470
I only meant the path is dreadfully bumpy.

666
00:48:18,640 --> 00:48:19,780
Jake could trip.

667
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:21,710
Perhaps you could show him the shortcuts.

668
00:48:21,880 --> 00:48:24,750
Should he ever need to avoid bumps.

669
00:48:25,160 --> 00:48:26,890
Won't you at least stay to see the reset, Jake?

670
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:29,130
It's really quite spectacular.

671
00:48:29,160 --> 00:48:30,950
Yeah! Stay, Jake!

672
00:51:12,840 --> 00:51:13,980
What was that?

673
00:51:14,160 --> 00:51:15,830
It was my phone.

674
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:18,750
It's been dead the whole time in the loop. I guess now...

675
00:51:18,920 --> 00:51:20,230
Your phone?

676
00:51:20,920 --> 00:51:23,480
Yeah. Like a telephone.

677
00:51:23,680 --> 00:51:25,980
You can call people...

678
00:51:26,160 --> 00:51:28,150
send written messages.

679
00:51:28,320 --> 00:51:30,150
Wait, you'll love this.

680
00:51:30,320 --> 00:51:31,910
You can take a picture.

681
00:51:32,080 --> 00:51:34,350
Press that, there. Yeah.

682
00:51:35,920 --> 00:51:36,980
See?

683
00:51:44,160 --> 00:51:45,630
What's wrong?

684
00:51:48,280 --> 00:51:51,670
It's just funny to think that one day, you'll grow up.

685
00:51:51,840 --> 00:51:53,030
Like Abe did.

686
00:51:53,760 --> 00:51:56,350
Get married, have children.

687
00:51:56,520 --> 00:51:57,660
Grandchildren.

688
00:51:58,440 --> 00:52:00,590
You might even show them this photograph.

689
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:03,470
And I'll still be here.

690
00:52:05,400 --> 00:52:07,590
Couldn't you leave some day?

691
00:52:07,760 --> 00:52:10,510
And live in the present, if you wanted to?

692
00:52:10,680 --> 00:52:11,680
No.

693
00:52:12,120 --> 00:52:13,490
More than a few minutes in your time

694
00:52:13,520 --> 00:52:15,150
and the years would catch up.

695
00:52:16,600 --> 00:52:18,070
You would age?

696
00:52:26,680 --> 00:52:28,750
I think it's the Ymbryne from Horace's dream.

697
00:52:29,240 --> 00:52:31,990
Are you sure it's not just a bird?

698
00:52:32,240 --> 00:52:33,670
I don't know, wouldn't it change?

699
00:52:33,840 --> 00:52:36,070
She can't. Not if she's hurt.

700
00:52:37,080 --> 00:52:39,750
I need to take her inside. You should go.

701
00:52:43,240 --> 00:52:44,670
Please don't say anything else.

702
00:52:44,760 --> 00:52:46,310
I hate goodbyes.

703
00:52:49,240 --> 00:52:50,240
I'll come back tomorrow.

704
00:52:51,520 --> 00:52:54,830
There's no hurry. I'll be here forever.

705
00:53:02,440 --> 00:53:03,440
Hey!

706
00:53:05,560 --> 00:53:06,730
I've been all over this damn island.

707
00:53:06,760 --> 00:53:07,870
Where the hell were you?

708
00:53:08,080 --> 00:53:10,110
Um, I was just on my way back.

709
00:53:10,280 --> 00:53:11,910
I'm sorry. I lost track of time.

710
00:53:12,960 --> 00:53:15,420
I was having a blast with Worm and Dirty D.

711
00:53:16,360 --> 00:53:17,420
Dirty D?

712
00:53:18,520 --> 00:53:19,710
You know what?

713
00:53:19,920 --> 00:53:22,070
This is good. This is healthy.

714
00:53:22,240 --> 00:53:23,910
You're making weird friends...

715
00:53:24,960 --> 00:53:26,950
and doing teenage stuff.

716
00:53:27,120 --> 00:53:28,120
I think this is normal.

717
00:53:28,240 --> 00:53:29,710
I'm sure Doctor Golan will approve.

718
00:53:29,880 --> 00:53:31,590
Hey, you. American!

719
00:53:31,760 --> 00:53:32,950
Get over here.

720
00:53:34,880 --> 00:53:35,940
Oh, look. There they are.

721
00:53:36,120 --> 00:53:39,310
There's D-Bag and Worm Man.

722
00:53:39,480 --> 00:53:40,590
Did you do this?

723
00:53:42,080 --> 00:53:44,310
What? No.

724
00:53:44,920 --> 00:53:45,950
Of course not.

725
00:53:46,480 --> 00:53:47,590
It wasn't us.

726
00:53:48,240 --> 00:53:49,930
Listen, sir. I don't know what happened here.

727
00:53:49,960 --> 00:53:52,990
But my son and his friends have been together all day.

728
00:53:53,160 --> 00:53:55,430
Jake would never do anything like this.

729
00:53:55,600 --> 00:53:57,110
Bollocks! We haven't seen him!

730
00:53:57,280 --> 00:53:58,390
You paid us yesterday.

731
00:53:58,480 --> 00:54:00,310
Why would we hang out with him today for free?

732
00:54:03,160 --> 00:54:06,150
Jake? Were you with them or not?

733
00:54:07,520 --> 00:54:09,630
No. I'm sorry.

734
00:54:10,640 --> 00:54:12,470
But you don't seriously think I could do this?

735
00:54:13,720 --> 00:54:15,310
I think we're done here, sir.

736
00:54:16,840 --> 00:54:18,990
Can you pass on a message for me?

737
00:54:19,160 --> 00:54:21,150
Can you tell Doctor Golan...

738
00:54:21,360 --> 00:54:23,710
that if she hadn't encouraged this cockamamie trip...

739
00:54:23,880 --> 00:54:25,020
maybe my son wouldn't be

740
00:54:25,160 --> 00:54:26,850
moping around all day in a derelict house...

741
00:54:26,880 --> 00:54:28,710
having a goddamn breakdown!

742
00:54:29,680 --> 00:54:30,820
Hello?

743
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:32,510
Dad, I'm not.

744
00:54:33,320 --> 00:54:34,320
I'm fine.

745
00:54:34,480 --> 00:54:36,190
No. You're not.

746
00:54:37,320 --> 00:54:39,310
You're not fine, Jake.

747
00:54:40,360 --> 00:54:42,990
Coming here was a terrible, terrible idea.

748
00:54:43,680 --> 00:54:45,630
Look, I'm sorry I lied. I just wanted...

749
00:54:45,840 --> 00:54:48,300
Just set your alarm for 8:00 a.m.

750
00:54:48,760 --> 00:54:50,710
I wanna get to the beach early.

751
00:54:50,880 --> 00:54:51,970
The rest of the time we're stuck

752
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:53,140
on this craphole island...

753
00:54:53,320 --> 00:54:54,710
we're sticking together.

754
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:57,030
Where are you going?

755
00:54:57,200 --> 00:54:59,230
Downstairs for a drink.

756
00:55:48,120 --> 00:55:49,200
Dear Miss Peregrine...

757
00:55:49,720 --> 00:55:51,390
I don't wish to alarm you...

758
00:55:51,560 --> 00:55:54,120
but one of my informants sent me this.

759
00:55:54,880 --> 00:55:57,390
It would appear that some of Mr. Barron's group...

760
00:55:57,560 --> 00:55:59,390
are in Blackpool, England.

761
00:56:00,600 --> 00:56:01,950
If I recall...

762
00:56:02,120 --> 00:56:04,420
Miss Avocet has a loop there.

763
00:56:05,080 --> 00:56:06,990
Please warn her and suggest...

764
00:56:07,160 --> 00:56:08,990
that she make a new one right away...

765
00:56:09,160 --> 00:56:10,270
well-hidden.

766
00:56:10,440 --> 00:56:13,000
And take the greatest care yourself.

767
00:56:13,160 --> 00:56:14,910
With love, Abe.

768
00:56:15,080 --> 00:56:17,070
January, 2016.

769
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:37,510
Who's ready to hit the beach?

770
00:56:44,200 --> 00:56:45,670
Oh, my...

771
00:56:46,360 --> 00:56:47,360
Unbelievable.

772
00:56:49,160 --> 00:56:51,030
Right in the middle of a nesting area?

773
00:56:51,200 --> 00:56:53,470
What kind of idiot does that?

774
00:56:54,840 --> 00:56:57,670
Actually, the main nesting area is over there.

775
00:56:58,280 --> 00:56:59,830
I can show you if you'd like.

776
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:02,190
It's marvelous to meet a fellow bird spotter.

777
00:57:02,320 --> 00:57:03,350
John Lamont.

778
00:57:03,560 --> 00:57:05,630
Franklin Portman. This is my son, Jake.

779
00:57:06,360 --> 00:57:07,500
John Lamont.

780
00:57:07,680 --> 00:57:09,240
That's a hell of a camera you got there.

781
00:57:10,040 --> 00:57:12,670
Oh, thanks. It's absolutely fantastic.

782
00:57:12,840 --> 00:57:16,190
I'm here to do some snaps for a book I'm writing.

783
00:57:16,360 --> 00:57:18,190
So, you gentlemen here on holiday?

784
00:57:21,640 --> 00:57:24,150
Unfortunately, her wings were flapping

785
00:57:24,240 --> 00:57:25,270
as much as the bird's!

786
00:57:27,480 --> 00:57:28,560
I think you fellas are

787
00:57:28,640 --> 00:57:29,850
thinking of another kind of bird.

788
00:57:29,880 --> 00:57:31,440
So, you're not going to the beach today?

789
00:57:32,040 --> 00:57:33,350
What's the point?

790
00:57:33,520 --> 00:57:35,110
If that guy is gonna cover Cairnholm

791
00:57:35,200 --> 00:57:36,670
in some big, glossy book...

792
00:57:36,840 --> 00:57:38,470
no one's gonna even wanna look at mine.

793
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:41,910
Might just have a nice afternoon nap.

794
00:57:42,760 --> 00:57:44,270
I don't suppose you saw Uncle Oggie

795
00:57:44,360 --> 00:57:46,190
on your travels this morning, did you?

796
00:57:46,400 --> 00:57:47,910
He's usually here by now.

797
00:57:48,080 --> 00:57:49,190
I could go look for him.

798
00:57:49,920 --> 00:57:51,390
You're not going anywhere.

799
00:58:27,080 --> 00:58:29,430
Jake, you're back! Come and play!

800
00:58:34,120 --> 00:58:36,070
I need to see Miss Peregrine first.

801
00:58:36,240 --> 00:58:37,590
Do you know where she is?

802
00:58:42,920 --> 00:58:45,550
Jake. You're back. How wonderful!

803
00:58:46,280 --> 00:58:47,280
How's it doing?

804
00:58:47,920 --> 00:58:49,230
Emma said it was an Ymbryne.

805
00:58:49,800 --> 00:58:51,230
"She." Not "it."

806
00:58:51,400 --> 00:58:53,270
Ymbrynes are always female.

807
00:58:53,440 --> 00:58:54,830
And Emma was quite correct.

808
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:56,590
This is Miss Avocet.

809
00:58:56,800 --> 00:58:59,550
Her loop's in Blackpool. England.

810
00:59:02,280 --> 00:59:04,430
That was a private letter, Jake.

811
00:59:07,160 --> 00:59:08,630
Who is Mr. Barron?

812
00:59:11,640 --> 00:59:13,070
Miss Peregrine, if my Grandpa

813
00:59:13,160 --> 00:59:15,110
was involved with dangerous people...

814
00:59:15,320 --> 00:59:16,830
I need to tell the police.

815
00:59:18,120 --> 00:59:19,120
Police?

816
00:59:20,320 --> 00:59:22,670
Are you implying Abe died an unnatural death?

817
00:59:23,200 --> 00:59:24,790
I found him in the woods...

818
00:59:24,960 --> 00:59:26,990
with his eyes missing.

819
00:59:27,160 --> 00:59:28,990
I'd say that was pretty unnatural.

820
00:59:33,640 --> 00:59:36,830
Unless essential, I don't discuss unpleasant matters.

821
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:39,460
An Ymbryne's duty is to protect children, Jake.

822
00:59:40,680 --> 00:59:42,270
I'm not a child.

823
00:59:43,320 --> 00:59:45,880
He wanted you to tell me everything!

824
00:59:50,880 --> 00:59:52,830
Oh. How frustrating for you.

825
00:59:53,360 --> 00:59:54,710
Between Miss Peregrine's rules...

826
00:59:54,880 --> 00:59:57,000
and my housemates' little pact not to scare you off...

827
00:59:57,040 --> 00:59:59,150
it's like no one's telling you anything!

828
01:00:00,520 --> 01:00:02,310
Why don't you, then?

829
01:00:02,400 --> 01:00:03,830
It's not like you want me here.

830
01:00:04,360 --> 01:00:06,820
Enoch, you can't. You promised.

831
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:09,190
Olive's right.

832
01:00:10,040 --> 01:00:11,330
I do know someone who can get away

833
01:00:11,360 --> 01:00:12,710
with breaking rules though.

834
01:00:13,360 --> 01:00:14,630
Want to meet him?

835
01:00:16,080 --> 01:00:18,640
Enoch, don't do this. Please!

836
01:00:18,840 --> 01:00:20,170
You want to spend time with me and Jake,

837
01:00:20,200 --> 01:00:21,340
we can all play together.

838
01:00:21,520 --> 01:00:22,830
That's what you said.

839
01:00:24,200 --> 01:00:25,910
Here we all are.

840
01:00:27,200 --> 01:00:28,870
Move, Olive.

841
01:00:29,040 --> 01:00:30,280
If you're going to be like that,

842
01:00:30,360 --> 01:00:32,660
then I don't want to be your friend.

843
01:00:35,440 --> 01:00:39,390
Enoch, leave Victor alone. It really upsets Bronwyn.

844
01:00:39,560 --> 01:00:41,350
Stop fussing, Fiona.

845
01:00:41,440 --> 01:00:43,120
Don't you think Jake should meet everybody?

846
01:00:43,240 --> 01:00:44,760
He's trying to frighten you away, Jake.

847
01:00:44,880 --> 01:00:47,670
He was always jealous of Abe. And now he's jealous of you.

848
01:00:47,840 --> 01:00:49,230
Come and play with us instead.

849
01:00:53,440 --> 01:00:56,270
I'd quite like to meet Victor.

850
01:01:02,880 --> 01:01:04,070
After you.

851
01:01:12,600 --> 01:01:13,630
Hello, Victor.

852
01:01:14,760 --> 01:01:17,870
I'm Jake. I'm sorry to disturb...

853
01:01:21,560 --> 01:01:22,780
Yeah, he can't hear you.

854
01:01:48,280 --> 01:01:50,150
Hello, Jake. I'm Victor.

855
01:01:50,280 --> 01:01:51,670
Do you want to know what killed me?

856
01:01:59,640 --> 01:02:01,470
There you are. Is Enoch with you?

857
01:02:01,600 --> 01:02:03,070
It's time for our daily walk.

858
01:02:06,080 --> 01:02:08,460
Emma, who killed Victor?

859
01:02:08,640 --> 01:02:10,310
Was it the people with the white eyes?

860
01:02:10,480 --> 01:02:12,110
I asked you not to ask questions.

861
01:02:12,280 --> 01:02:15,270
I saw one the night my grandpa died.

862
01:02:15,440 --> 01:02:16,470
A man.

863
01:02:18,440 --> 01:02:19,470
If it really was one,

864
01:02:19,600 --> 01:02:21,190
you have to tell Miss Peregrine.

865
01:02:21,360 --> 01:02:23,470
Could you recognize him from a photograph?

866
01:02:23,640 --> 01:02:25,030
Do you have one?

867
01:02:26,360 --> 01:02:28,310
Come on. There's somewhere I go to be alone.

868
01:02:28,440 --> 01:02:29,870
I have things there.

869
01:03:07,240 --> 01:03:08,510
Is this the place?

870
01:03:08,720 --> 01:03:10,870
No. This is how we get there.

871
01:03:30,400 --> 01:03:32,230
Oh! Emma! Your shoes!

872
01:03:32,400 --> 01:03:33,830
Lead shoes!

873
01:05:35,840 --> 01:05:37,350
Welcome to my secret hideout.

874
01:05:39,720 --> 01:05:41,470
How did you...

875
01:05:41,560 --> 01:05:42,620
Air.

876
01:05:43,360 --> 01:05:44,990
It's my peculiarity.

877
01:05:45,640 --> 01:05:47,510
It does what I want.

878
01:06:06,560 --> 01:06:07,750
Jake...

879
01:06:07,920 --> 01:06:09,550
before your grandfather retired...

880
01:06:09,720 --> 01:06:11,870
he asked me to keep this safe.

881
01:06:30,040 --> 01:06:31,350
This is my grandpa's old map.

882
01:06:31,520 --> 01:06:33,070
It shows you where the loops are.

883
01:06:44,360 --> 01:06:45,910
That's him!

884
01:06:46,080 --> 01:06:47,750
That's the man I saw.

885
01:06:48,200 --> 01:06:49,910
Who is he? That's Barron.

886
01:06:50,080 --> 01:06:51,080
He's the leader.

887
01:06:52,400 --> 01:06:53,750
The leader of what?

888
01:06:54,600 --> 01:06:55,790
Who are these people?

889
01:06:57,080 --> 01:06:59,910
Bad people. Bad peculiars.

890
01:07:00,720 --> 01:07:03,590
Abe dedicated his life to hunting them down.

891
01:07:03,760 --> 01:07:05,590
These are the ones he never found.

892
01:07:06,440 --> 01:07:08,270
What do you mean, hunting?

893
01:07:11,280 --> 01:07:13,070
They raided loops.

894
01:07:13,240 --> 01:07:16,630
Whole homes full of children left for dead.

895
01:07:17,120 --> 01:07:19,310
Abe took lives to save lives.

896
01:07:19,480 --> 01:07:22,310
He only retired when you were born to protect you.

897
01:07:23,400 --> 01:07:24,460
From what?

898
01:07:28,600 --> 01:07:29,660
If I tell you the rest,

899
01:07:29,800 --> 01:07:31,830
you have to promise not to run away.

900
01:07:33,080 --> 01:07:36,110
Jake, you belong here.

901
01:07:36,320 --> 01:07:37,670
You know I don't.

902
01:07:37,840 --> 01:07:39,790
I'm not like you.

903
01:07:40,480 --> 01:07:41,750
I'm just ordinary.

904
01:07:41,920 --> 01:07:43,270
No, you're not.

905
01:07:43,440 --> 01:07:44,470
Jake...

906
01:07:44,640 --> 01:07:47,510
only a peculiar can enter a time loop.

907
01:07:50,160 --> 01:07:52,150
No. That can't be right.

908
01:07:52,800 --> 01:07:54,190
I would know.

909
01:07:55,160 --> 01:07:56,160
Fine.

910
01:07:58,160 --> 01:07:59,830
Then I'll show you something else.

911
01:08:07,320 --> 01:08:08,460
Hurry. You'll miss it.

912
01:08:22,320 --> 01:08:25,670
Ymbrynes usually pick the perfect day to create a loop.

913
01:08:25,840 --> 01:08:27,800
But Miss Peregrine had to make this one in a rush.

914
01:08:29,080 --> 01:08:30,080
Why?

915
01:08:30,720 --> 01:08:32,890
Because the Germans were about to drop a bomb on the house.

916
01:08:32,920 --> 01:08:34,350
The point is...

917
01:08:34,520 --> 01:08:37,350
September the 3rd, 1943 wasn't perfect.

918
01:08:38,680 --> 01:08:40,910
The thing that killed Victor came back.

919
01:09:08,080 --> 01:09:09,110
Wait! Watch out!

920
01:09:09,880 --> 01:09:11,100
You'll put her off!

921
01:09:39,640 --> 01:09:41,390
You can see it, can't you?

922
01:09:41,920 --> 01:09:43,430
No one else can.

923
01:09:43,920 --> 01:09:46,070
It's invisible, Jake.

924
01:09:46,280 --> 01:09:47,680
That was Abe's greatest gift of all.

925
01:09:50,880 --> 01:09:52,430
He could see the monsters.

926
01:09:57,760 --> 01:09:59,750
We call them Hollowgast.

927
01:09:59,960 --> 01:10:01,100
Hollows for short.

928
01:10:01,960 --> 01:10:05,910
My grandpa told me about people who turn into monsters.

929
01:10:06,080 --> 01:10:07,430
Is that what they are?

930
01:10:08,400 --> 01:10:10,430
I will explain everything, Jake.

931
01:10:10,640 --> 01:10:12,750
I fear it's my duty now, considering.

932
01:10:12,920 --> 01:10:13,970
But you should know that in doing so,

933
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:15,160
I'm breaking a solemn promise.

934
01:10:18,000 --> 01:10:19,950
I knew you were peculiar when you were born.

935
01:10:20,480 --> 01:10:22,830
But your grandfather forbid me to tell you anything.

936
01:10:23,000 --> 01:10:26,310
His dearest wish was for you to have an ordinary childhood.

937
01:10:26,840 --> 01:10:28,630
I definitely had that.

938
01:10:28,800 --> 01:10:31,310
He intended to tell you the truth when you turned 18.

939
01:10:31,840 --> 01:10:36,310
He hoped his bedtime stories would pave the way.

940
01:10:38,160 --> 01:10:39,510
Here's my book.

941
01:10:50,880 --> 01:10:52,350
Many years ago...

942
01:10:53,040 --> 01:10:55,790
a splinter faction emerged among our people.

943
01:10:55,960 --> 01:10:58,520
Disaffected peculiars tired of living in loops.

944
01:10:59,200 --> 01:11:01,630
That's Mr. Barron.

945
01:11:01,800 --> 01:11:03,830
He believed that by harnessing the essence

946
01:11:03,960 --> 01:11:05,550
of an Ymbryne's powers...

947
01:11:05,720 --> 01:11:08,470
he and his cronies could gain immortality...

948
01:11:08,640 --> 01:11:10,990
and be able to live outside loops.

949
01:11:11,200 --> 01:11:13,310
He devised an experiment.

950
01:11:16,480 --> 01:11:18,310
He kidnapped an Ymbryne...

951
01:11:18,400 --> 01:11:19,400
not knowing or caring

952
01:11:19,520 --> 01:11:21,350
whether she would survive the experiment.

953
01:11:42,680 --> 01:11:44,790
But the fate of Barron and his group

954
01:11:44,880 --> 01:11:46,270
was more horrifying still.

955
01:12:23,600 --> 01:12:25,900
Why didn't Barron turn into one?

956
01:12:39,400 --> 01:12:40,790
He did.

957
01:12:41,000 --> 01:12:42,590
But years later...

958
01:12:42,760 --> 01:12:44,950
he found a way to reverse the effects.

959
01:12:45,120 --> 01:12:46,590
To regain humanity.

960
01:12:46,760 --> 01:12:50,110
They had become not immortal gods, but Hollows.

961
01:12:50,280 --> 01:12:52,580
Invisible beasts, dangerous...

962
01:12:52,800 --> 01:12:54,790
cold-blooded, deadly.

963
01:12:54,960 --> 01:12:56,680
Remember I told you they raided loops?

964
01:12:57,640 --> 01:12:58,830
This is why.

965
01:12:59,440 --> 01:13:01,440
Barron discovered that by consuming

966
01:13:01,520 --> 01:13:03,670
the eyes of other peculiars...

967
01:13:03,840 --> 01:13:05,950
especially children...

968
01:13:13,440 --> 01:13:14,990
he began to change.

969
01:13:33,280 --> 01:13:34,590
Consume enough, and a Hollow

970
01:13:34,720 --> 01:13:36,470
can fully regain its human form.

971
01:13:36,680 --> 01:13:37,990
Bon appetit.

972
01:13:38,680 --> 01:13:41,030
Just as Barron and some of his friends did.

973
01:13:50,360 --> 01:13:52,150
The rest of them are stuck as Hollows.

974
01:13:54,720 --> 01:13:58,190
Are you saying that Barron ate my grand...

975
01:13:58,360 --> 01:14:00,050
He needs no more eyes himself.

976
01:14:00,080 --> 01:14:03,830
But I fear he led a Hollow to your grandfather. Yes.

977
01:14:05,640 --> 01:14:07,990
After the first attacks on loops...

978
01:14:08,160 --> 01:14:10,510
we all got better at hiding, making new loops,

979
01:14:10,640 --> 01:14:12,190
keeping our whereabouts secret.

980
01:14:13,480 --> 01:14:15,860
The Hollows grow more desperate every year...

981
01:14:16,040 --> 01:14:18,670
and Barron wishes to help his friends.

982
01:14:18,840 --> 01:14:21,070
Miss Peregrine, come quickly. Miss Avocet's awake.

983
01:14:24,880 --> 01:14:26,430
And suddenly, I flew into it again...

984
01:14:26,600 --> 01:14:28,830
Bang! Bang! I couldn't see anything.

985
01:14:29,400 --> 01:14:31,860
Oh, Miss Peregrine. They found my new loop.

986
01:14:32,040 --> 01:14:34,910
The children. I tried to save them...

987
01:14:35,080 --> 01:14:36,670
but there were so many Hollows.

988
01:14:36,840 --> 01:14:38,550
I don't know how I escaped.

989
01:14:41,080 --> 01:14:42,220
You're safe now.

990
01:14:42,400 --> 01:14:44,230
None of us are safe.

991
01:14:44,400 --> 01:14:46,350
They set up the machine in my loop.

992
01:14:46,520 --> 01:14:48,510
They put it in the cellars at Blackpool Tower.

993
01:14:48,680 --> 01:14:49,900
They're still there.

994
01:14:50,080 --> 01:14:51,910
Their machine? The experiment.

995
01:14:52,080 --> 01:14:54,510
They intend to do it again.

996
01:14:54,680 --> 01:14:56,750
This time, he's using more Ymbrynes.

997
01:14:56,920 --> 01:14:58,790
He still wants to be immortal.

998
01:15:02,880 --> 01:15:04,790
Do Hollows only attack peculiars?

999
01:15:04,960 --> 01:15:06,180
Of course not.

1000
01:15:07,040 --> 01:15:08,310
They're monsters, Jake.

1001
01:15:08,440 --> 01:15:10,590
They'll slaughter anything in their path.

1002
01:15:10,760 --> 01:15:13,030
Some sheep on the island were killed.

1003
01:15:13,600 --> 01:15:15,790
You don't think they're here already, do you?

1004
01:15:16,320 --> 01:15:18,230
Have you seen anyone with white eyes?

1005
01:15:22,800 --> 01:15:24,750
I'm sorry, children. We can't remain here.

1006
01:15:24,920 --> 01:15:25,920
What?

1007
01:15:26,120 --> 01:15:28,280
We'll leave on the first ferry off the island tomorrow.

1008
01:15:28,440 --> 01:15:30,110
Pack anything of importance.

1009
01:15:30,240 --> 01:15:31,950
Then it's sandwiches and early to bed.

1010
01:15:32,120 --> 01:15:33,430
Are we leaving for good?

1011
01:15:33,600 --> 01:15:35,270
When are we coming back? Never.

1012
01:15:35,440 --> 01:15:36,520
If Miss Peregrine's not here

1013
01:15:36,600 --> 01:15:37,990
to reset the loop tomorrow night...

1014
01:15:38,160 --> 01:15:39,160
the house gets bombed.

1015
01:15:39,320 --> 01:15:40,460
But our house.

1016
01:15:40,680 --> 01:15:41,710
Don't cry.

1017
01:15:41,800 --> 01:15:42,920
Miss Peregrine will find you

1018
01:15:42,960 --> 01:15:44,400
another lovely house, somewhere else.

1019
01:15:51,560 --> 01:15:53,430
Once this loop closes, that's it.

1020
01:15:53,600 --> 01:15:55,390
I can't get back to my own time.

1021
01:15:55,880 --> 01:15:57,430
You didn't seem very happy there.

1022
01:15:57,600 --> 01:16:00,950
I can't just leave! I have a family!

1023
01:16:01,160 --> 01:16:02,510
And you felt ordinary.

1024
01:16:02,680 --> 01:16:05,110
Like, nothing you do changes anything!

1025
01:16:05,280 --> 01:16:06,870
Now you have a chance to do something

1026
01:16:06,960 --> 01:16:08,390
that changes everything!

1027
01:16:09,320 --> 01:16:11,310
Jake, we're in danger.

1028
01:16:11,480 --> 01:16:13,940
And you're the only one who can see the Hollows.

1029
01:16:14,120 --> 01:16:17,150
Yeah, see them, sure. But I'm not my grandpa!

1030
01:16:18,160 --> 01:16:20,350
I'm not, and I can't fight.

1031
01:16:20,520 --> 01:16:22,110
I can't kill somebody.

1032
01:16:25,920 --> 01:16:28,550
There's only one reason that I'd stay here...

1033
01:16:28,720 --> 01:16:29,720
Please.

1034
01:16:30,760 --> 01:16:32,270
Just go.

1035
01:17:00,800 --> 01:17:03,360
Jake? Jakey, there you are.

1036
01:17:03,520 --> 01:17:04,550
Thank God!

1037
01:17:04,760 --> 01:17:06,950
When I heard they found a body, I freaked.

1038
01:17:31,600 --> 01:17:33,270
Are there stray dogs around here?

1039
01:17:34,120 --> 01:17:35,120
What you talking about?

1040
01:17:36,640 --> 01:17:38,190
It's like...

1041
01:17:38,360 --> 01:17:39,830
when they find an injured animal,

1042
01:17:39,920 --> 01:17:41,990
they go for the soft parts first.

1043
01:17:43,480 --> 01:17:45,070
Same thing happened to my father.

1044
01:17:45,840 --> 01:17:48,030
The police are on their way.

1045
01:17:49,160 --> 01:17:50,430
Look, Dad. I've gotta go.

1046
01:17:50,640 --> 01:17:52,670
What? No. You don't, Jake.

1047
01:17:53,400 --> 01:17:54,480
If this wasn't an accident,

1048
01:17:54,560 --> 01:17:55,800
there's a lunatic on the island.

1049
01:17:56,280 --> 01:17:58,840
I've known everyone on this island my whole life.

1050
01:17:59,000 --> 01:18:00,870
Except you, and him.

1051
01:18:01,440 --> 01:18:02,850
And he's been in the pub all afternoon.

1052
01:18:02,880 --> 01:18:04,790
So have I. I was sleeping.

1053
01:18:04,960 --> 01:18:06,640
What about the blind fellow?

1054
01:18:06,760 --> 01:18:09,140
I assumed he was blind.

1055
01:18:09,320 --> 01:18:10,870
Gentleman with the dark glasses...

1056
01:18:11,080 --> 01:18:13,030
arrived on the same ferry as me?

1057
01:18:13,200 --> 01:18:15,070
I kept seeing him around.

1058
01:18:15,800 --> 01:18:16,830
Jake!

1059
01:18:17,600 --> 01:18:18,630
Jake!

1060
01:18:19,320 --> 01:18:22,430
Jake! Wait!

1061
01:18:26,880 --> 01:18:28,230
Is your son all right?

1062
01:18:28,400 --> 01:18:29,400
No.

1063
01:18:29,480 --> 01:18:32,790
He has mental health issues.

1064
01:18:32,960 --> 01:18:33,990
I can't go.

1065
01:18:34,080 --> 01:18:36,460
Let me. I run 5-Ks all the time.

1066
01:18:50,400 --> 01:18:51,400
Hello?

1067
01:18:56,040 --> 01:18:57,070
Hello?

1068
01:18:58,120 --> 01:18:59,430
Is that you, young man?

1069
01:19:01,200 --> 01:19:02,510
You came through...

1070
01:19:03,480 --> 01:19:04,830
You're peculiar?

1071
01:19:05,960 --> 01:19:07,100
Oh, yes.

1072
01:19:08,120 --> 01:19:11,030
And I'm extremely grateful to you.

1073
01:19:11,760 --> 01:19:14,220
Terribly hard to find loops these days.

1074
01:19:15,200 --> 01:19:17,990
So, you followed me from the beach on purpose?

1075
01:19:18,600 --> 01:19:19,790
Oh, no.

1076
01:19:20,400 --> 01:19:23,310
I've been following you much further than that.

1077
01:19:28,600 --> 01:19:30,070
Doctor Golan?

1078
01:19:30,600 --> 01:19:31,660
Sometimes.

1079
01:19:32,320 --> 01:19:33,710
When it suits me.

1080
01:19:34,560 --> 01:19:37,430
The breadth of my peculiarity...

1081
01:19:37,600 --> 01:19:40,510
is purely limited by my imagination.

1082
01:19:41,440 --> 01:19:43,630
The only thing I can't change...

1083
01:19:46,520 --> 01:19:48,310
is my eyes.

1084
01:19:54,320 --> 01:19:56,780
Mr. Barron. How do you do?

1085
01:20:00,240 --> 01:20:03,270
I saw you at your grandfather's.

1086
01:20:04,160 --> 01:20:05,190
I was hoping to get

1087
01:20:05,320 --> 01:20:06,530
Miss Peregrine's address from him.

1088
01:20:06,560 --> 01:20:08,350
But, alas, my traveling companion

1089
01:20:08,440 --> 01:20:10,230
got to him before I did.

1090
01:20:10,960 --> 01:20:12,150
As you know...

1091
01:20:12,320 --> 01:20:15,860
there's just no stopping a hungry Hollowgast!

1092
01:20:19,480 --> 01:20:22,310
Speaking of my traveling companion...

1093
01:20:23,880 --> 01:20:24,910
he's coming.

1094
01:20:25,320 --> 01:20:27,910
Believe me when I say to you...

1095
01:20:28,080 --> 01:20:30,910
you don't want to be here...

1096
01:20:31,080 --> 01:20:33,110
when he arrives.

1097
01:20:34,480 --> 01:20:37,630
So, let's be on our way.

1098
01:20:38,760 --> 01:20:39,790
Shall we?

1099
01:20:45,480 --> 01:20:46,830
Excuse me.

1100
01:20:51,760 --> 01:20:52,790
Wait for me.

1101
01:20:57,160 --> 01:20:58,490
I mustn't forget our calendar.

1102
01:20:58,520 --> 01:20:59,650
Could you fetch it from the parlor

1103
01:20:59,680 --> 01:21:00,820
please, Miss Avocet?

1104
01:21:04,720 --> 01:21:06,150
Go and help the others.

1105
01:21:19,520 --> 01:21:21,590
Miss Peregrine, what a pleasure

1106
01:21:21,680 --> 01:21:22,950
to meet you at last!

1107
01:21:24,240 --> 01:21:26,030
May we come in?

1108
01:21:32,920 --> 01:21:34,030
Children!

1109
01:21:34,440 --> 01:21:37,350
Would you make your way down the stairs, please?

1110
01:21:37,520 --> 01:21:40,270
I give the orders in this house, Mr. Barron.

1111
01:21:40,440 --> 01:21:41,500
Not today.

1112
01:21:42,000 --> 01:21:45,470
You should know that Jake has served his purpose.

1113
01:21:45,640 --> 01:21:47,350
If you value his life, I suggest

1114
01:21:47,440 --> 01:21:49,820
everyone does as they're told.

1115
01:21:50,000 --> 01:21:51,550
Children! Shush!

1116
01:21:52,640 --> 01:21:55,350
No one tells my children what to do!

1117
01:21:57,040 --> 01:21:58,040
Children...

1118
01:21:58,440 --> 01:22:00,390
come down here, please.

1119
01:22:03,720 --> 01:22:04,750
Miss Peregrine...

1120
01:22:04,840 --> 01:22:06,670
I thought I told you to be quiet.

1121
01:22:09,560 --> 01:22:10,620
Children...

1122
01:22:10,800 --> 01:22:12,750
for Jake's safety...

1123
01:22:12,920 --> 01:22:15,380
we're going to do what Mr. Barron asks.

1124
01:22:16,080 --> 01:22:17,300
He wishes to take me with him

1125
01:22:17,400 --> 01:22:18,870
to his rendezvous in Blackpool.

1126
01:22:19,040 --> 01:22:20,630
So, for his protection...

1127
01:22:20,800 --> 01:22:22,230
he'd like me to assume bird form,

1128
01:22:22,320 --> 01:22:23,750
preferably caged.

1129
01:22:23,920 --> 01:22:25,990
He'd like you to make your way into a lockable room,

1130
01:22:26,080 --> 01:22:27,510
such as the parlor...

1131
01:22:27,680 --> 01:22:29,310
as he won't release Jake if he fears

1132
01:22:29,400 --> 01:22:30,880
an attack could be mounted upon him...

1133
01:22:30,960 --> 01:22:32,630
once he loses his leverage.

1134
01:22:33,320 --> 01:22:34,590
Correct, Mr. Barron?

1135
01:22:35,960 --> 01:22:37,960
You're sacrificing yourself and all of us...

1136
01:22:38,800 --> 01:22:39,990
for Jake?

1137
01:22:40,160 --> 01:22:42,830
Mr. Barron travels with a Hollow, Enoch.

1138
01:22:43,000 --> 01:22:46,030
Once it arrives here, we're all dead.

1139
01:22:47,680 --> 01:22:50,790
Enoch. Only Jake can see them.

1140
01:22:50,960 --> 01:22:52,950
She means he's our only hope.

1141
01:23:37,320 --> 01:23:39,110
It's been my privilege...

1142
01:23:40,040 --> 01:23:41,670
to care for you all.

1143
01:23:44,280 --> 01:23:45,630
Goodbye, my children.

1144
01:23:55,560 --> 01:23:56,560
Now let him go.

1145
01:24:19,880 --> 01:24:21,070
Promise me one thing, Jake.

1146
01:24:24,720 --> 01:24:27,070
That you will try to look after them all.

1147
01:24:30,880 --> 01:24:32,310
I promise.

1148
01:25:08,800 --> 01:25:09,800
It's getting dark.

1149
01:25:10,200 --> 01:25:12,030
You won't even be able to see their shadows.

1150
01:25:12,200 --> 01:25:13,260
We have to stay inside.

1151
01:25:13,360 --> 01:25:14,950
It's the only place we stand a chance.

1152
01:25:15,120 --> 01:25:16,830
He's quite right. Now, where does

1153
01:25:16,920 --> 01:25:18,430
Miss Peregrine keep her weapon?

1154
01:25:18,960 --> 01:25:20,390
In there. Let's go.

1155
01:25:20,560 --> 01:25:21,950
Now, all right, children.

1156
01:25:22,120 --> 01:25:23,330
Make sure all the doors are locked,

1157
01:25:23,360 --> 01:25:25,030
and the windows are latched.

1158
01:25:25,200 --> 01:25:27,470
Everything must be sealed up tight. Now quickly.

1159
01:25:27,680 --> 01:25:28,790
Quickly! Go!

1160
01:25:39,440 --> 01:25:40,470
Here.

1161
01:25:44,120 --> 01:25:46,830
Jake, I think tonight, you better answer that.

1162
01:25:47,000 --> 01:25:48,000
Okay.

1163
01:25:52,440 --> 01:25:53,470
Hello?

1164
01:25:53,560 --> 01:25:54,770
Hello, this is Abe.

1165
01:25:54,800 --> 01:25:55,910
Who's that?

1166
01:26:00,640 --> 01:26:03,550
You don't know me yet. I'm Jake.

1167
01:26:03,760 --> 01:26:06,910
Ah, you're new. Welcome to the family, Jake.

1168
01:26:07,080 --> 01:26:08,510
Now, I can't talk long...

1169
01:26:08,720 --> 01:26:09,990
so just tell Miss Peregrine...

1170
01:26:10,160 --> 01:26:12,150
I'm at the air base, and I'm fine.

1171
01:26:15,040 --> 01:26:18,740
I just wanted to say that I miss you...

1172
01:26:19,600 --> 01:26:21,550
and if I disappointed you...

1173
01:26:21,720 --> 01:26:23,150
I'm sorry.

1174
01:26:24,080 --> 01:26:26,910
You're the best grandpa in the world.

1175
01:26:51,440 --> 01:26:53,110
Fiona. Got it.

1176
01:26:54,240 --> 01:26:55,240
Miss Avocet.

1177
01:26:56,080 --> 01:26:57,140
Now, children.

1178
01:26:57,320 --> 01:26:59,430
Now that you're all here, there's a few rules.

1179
01:26:59,600 --> 01:27:01,950
Your primary job is to stay safe.

1180
01:27:02,120 --> 01:27:03,390
Leave the Hollow to me.

1181
01:27:03,560 --> 01:27:05,390
I don't want to see any heroics.

1182
01:27:06,280 --> 01:27:08,190
Now those of you with garden tools...

1183
01:27:08,360 --> 01:27:10,510
I must insist that you...

1184
01:27:33,440 --> 01:27:34,750
No, Enoch. Get back!

1185
01:28:01,160 --> 01:28:02,190
Go. Get to the attic!

1186
01:28:06,320 --> 01:28:07,320
Take her.

1187
01:28:21,600 --> 01:28:23,390
Go. Get out!

1188
01:28:24,600 --> 01:28:25,600
Olive, come on!

1189
01:28:43,920 --> 01:28:45,590
Crap! It's almost reset!

1190
01:28:50,360 --> 01:28:52,660
Fiona, is there anything you can do with that tree?

1191
01:28:52,840 --> 01:28:54,510
Be careful.

1192
01:28:57,960 --> 01:28:59,230
We're going through the windows.

1193
01:28:59,320 --> 01:29:00,540
Let's go! Quickly!

1194
01:29:24,800 --> 01:29:25,860
Come on!

1195
01:29:36,680 --> 01:29:38,150
Claire, come on down.

1196
01:29:57,680 --> 01:29:59,430
Be careful.

1197
01:30:11,880 --> 01:30:13,390
Go, Fiona!

1198
01:30:21,080 --> 01:30:22,140
Let's go!

1199
01:30:46,160 --> 01:30:47,950
- Was that...
- The loop closing.

1200
01:30:49,400 --> 01:30:50,670
It's gone.

1201
01:31:11,920 --> 01:31:13,140
I'm sorry, Jake.

1202
01:31:13,960 --> 01:31:15,670
What do we do now?

1203
01:31:17,120 --> 01:31:19,270
Is there any sign of Barron and Miss Peregrine?

1204
01:31:19,800 --> 01:31:22,630
Gone. Barron must have had a boat.

1205
01:31:27,360 --> 01:31:28,830
We have to go after them.

1206
01:31:29,440 --> 01:31:31,110
We know he's taking her to Blackpool.

1207
01:31:31,280 --> 01:31:33,110
But Blackpool is miles away.

1208
01:31:33,280 --> 01:31:34,570
The next ferry doesn't go for hours.

1209
01:31:34,600 --> 01:31:35,820
We'll never make it in time.

1210
01:31:37,600 --> 01:31:39,550
Not unless we go by boat, too.

1211
01:33:26,200 --> 01:33:27,990
So, there's a loop here in Blackpool.

1212
01:33:28,200 --> 01:33:31,550
It's only six months old. January 11th, 2016.

1213
01:33:31,720 --> 01:33:34,510
With Miss Avocet gone, it can't be reset.

1214
01:33:34,680 --> 01:33:36,470
Won't the loop close?

1215
01:33:37,160 --> 01:33:38,710
Then it's back to real time.

1216
01:33:40,880 --> 01:33:43,030
Jake, you know what this means, don't you?

1217
01:33:43,720 --> 01:33:44,860
You're gonna die.

1218
01:33:45,040 --> 01:33:46,910
That's not what I mean.

1219
01:33:47,080 --> 01:33:48,390
We have to get to our own time,

1220
01:33:48,560 --> 01:33:49,560
but you don't.

1221
01:33:50,360 --> 01:33:53,670
You can continue to live in 2016.

1222
01:33:53,840 --> 01:33:55,430
But why would I do that?

1223
01:33:55,600 --> 01:33:57,190
If we kill Barron...

1224
01:33:57,400 --> 01:34:00,030
he'll be gone, but time will carry on.

1225
01:34:00,760 --> 01:34:02,550
He won't go to Florida...

1226
01:34:03,400 --> 01:34:07,180
Abe won't die, and you can go home.

1227
01:34:08,880 --> 01:34:11,070
I could see my grandpa.

1228
01:34:15,720 --> 01:34:18,230
Listen, I can explain everything to them.

1229
01:34:18,400 --> 01:34:21,350
I can persuade them to take me to the island and...

1230
01:34:21,520 --> 01:34:23,550
Wait, will you still be there?

1231
01:34:25,200 --> 01:34:27,390
Our old loop's gone for good.

1232
01:34:28,400 --> 01:34:30,350
We wouldn't see each other again.

1233
01:34:32,080 --> 01:34:34,230
I thought you wanted me to stay.

1234
01:34:36,960 --> 01:34:39,190
I know you'll choose Abe.

1235
01:34:39,920 --> 01:34:42,750
If I minded, I wouldn't have told you

1236
01:34:51,560 --> 01:34:53,230
So, have you found Miss Avocet's

1237
01:34:53,320 --> 01:34:54,590
loop on the map yet?

1238
01:34:55,480 --> 01:34:57,310
It's here. But it's new.

1239
01:34:57,480 --> 01:34:59,940
She made it early this year. That's my year.

1240
01:35:00,120 --> 01:35:01,560
If we don't get out before it closes,

1241
01:35:01,640 --> 01:35:03,390
we're stuck in January 2016.

1242
01:35:03,480 --> 01:35:04,510
Great.

1243
01:35:04,600 --> 01:35:06,350
Time catches up with all of us,

1244
01:35:06,440 --> 01:35:08,270
we all die, except you. Plan?

1245
01:35:08,760 --> 01:35:10,470
The loop closes at 4:30.

1246
01:35:10,680 --> 01:35:11,870
That means we need to get in,

1247
01:35:11,960 --> 01:35:13,400
rescue the Ymbrynes and then get out.

1248
01:35:14,120 --> 01:35:16,070
Yeah, if we're not already dead.

1249
01:35:16,240 --> 01:35:18,000
Miss Avocet said the machine is in the cellar

1250
01:35:18,120 --> 01:35:19,290
of the Blackpool Tower building.

1251
01:35:19,320 --> 01:35:22,070
That means we will be indoors... with Hollows.

1252
01:35:22,240 --> 01:35:24,590
No, we won't. I've got a plan.

1253
01:35:24,760 --> 01:35:26,270
But I'm gonna need your help.

1254
01:35:56,880 --> 01:35:58,510
This can't be it, can it?

1255
01:35:59,120 --> 01:36:01,070
Loop entrances can be anywhere.

1256
01:36:01,160 --> 01:36:03,350
The one in London's in a subway tunnel.

1257
01:36:16,040 --> 01:36:17,350
Are you sure this is it?

1258
01:36:20,400 --> 01:36:22,190
I think so.

1259
01:36:24,040 --> 01:36:26,390
Millard, there's something I need you to do first.

1260
01:36:26,560 --> 01:36:28,860
All right. I know.

1261
01:36:32,240 --> 01:36:34,750
Look. There's the tower. It's not far.

1262
01:36:34,920 --> 01:36:37,590
Easy for you to say. I'm freezing.

1263
01:36:43,720 --> 01:36:44,860
Ready?

1264
01:36:55,880 --> 01:36:58,180
All of the doors to the cellar are locked.

1265
01:36:58,360 --> 01:37:00,400
The only way to reach the Ymbrynes is through there.

1266
01:37:01,040 --> 01:37:02,350
It's backstage.

1267
01:37:02,520 --> 01:37:04,550
How many Hollows can you see?

1268
01:37:05,520 --> 01:37:07,350
Four. That's good news.

1269
01:37:07,920 --> 01:37:09,140
I think you and I have

1270
01:37:09,240 --> 01:37:10,910
very different definition of good news.

1271
01:37:11,080 --> 01:37:14,230
It means Barron's other friends haven't arrived yet.

1272
01:37:14,400 --> 01:37:16,070
So they haven't started the experiment.

1273
01:37:16,960 --> 01:37:18,390
We're not too late.

1274
01:37:20,240 --> 01:37:21,240
Okay, Emma.

1275
01:37:21,920 --> 01:37:23,630
You ready? You know what to say.

1276
01:37:23,800 --> 01:37:25,110
Here, Jake.

1277
01:37:27,560 --> 01:37:31,030
Our brethren should be joining us momentarily.

1278
01:37:31,240 --> 01:37:32,790
This is a day to...

1279
01:37:32,960 --> 01:37:34,470
You down there!

1280
01:37:34,600 --> 01:37:37,060
We killed your Hollow friend, Mr. Barron.

1281
01:37:37,240 --> 01:37:39,750
And now we've come for Miss Peregrine.

1282
01:37:39,920 --> 01:37:41,430
Bring her and all the other Ymbrynes

1283
01:37:41,560 --> 01:37:43,590
to the end of the pier in five minutes...

1284
01:37:43,760 --> 01:37:45,470
or face the consequences.

1285
01:37:49,640 --> 01:37:51,190
These children must be

1286
01:37:51,280 --> 01:37:53,310
as insane as their headmistress.

1287
01:37:53,920 --> 01:37:57,790
Still, the Hollows will be glad of a feed.

1288
01:38:00,640 --> 01:38:02,270
Where are you?

1289
01:38:03,000 --> 01:38:05,790
I know you're in here somewhere!

1290
01:38:08,800 --> 01:38:10,910
Good. Listen to me.

1291
01:38:11,080 --> 01:38:14,950
I want you to follow Mr. Archer and Mr. Clark.

1292
01:38:15,120 --> 01:38:16,880
They're going to take you down to the pier...

1293
01:38:17,000 --> 01:38:20,150
for a little afternoon tea.

1294
01:38:21,040 --> 01:38:22,990
Mr. Archer, Mr. Clark...

1295
01:38:23,160 --> 01:38:25,190
gather the Hollows and take them to the pier.

1296
01:38:25,360 --> 01:38:27,740
Those children killed Malthus?

1297
01:38:27,960 --> 01:38:29,310
Barron's had it in for Malthus

1298
01:38:29,440 --> 01:38:31,150
ever since he killed Abe Portman.

1299
01:38:31,320 --> 01:38:33,310
I tracked Abe Portman for months.

1300
01:38:35,440 --> 01:38:36,990
All I needed was a few minutes...

1301
01:38:37,160 --> 01:38:40,030
to get the location of Miss Peregrine's loop from him.

1302
01:38:40,200 --> 01:38:41,470
But no!

1303
01:38:41,680 --> 01:38:43,510
Malthus couldn't wait.

1304
01:38:44,000 --> 01:38:45,140
Instead...

1305
01:38:46,120 --> 01:38:49,550
I had to masquerade as a psychiatrist...

1306
01:38:49,720 --> 01:38:52,100
for three weeks...

1307
01:38:52,320 --> 01:38:53,670
in Florida!

1308
01:38:55,640 --> 01:38:57,510
Have you ever been to Florida?

1309
01:39:01,560 --> 01:39:04,390
Did I not tell you to gather the Hollows?

1310
01:39:04,560 --> 01:39:05,560
What if it's a trap?

1311
01:39:05,720 --> 01:39:07,830
Of course, it is, Miss Edwards. But what of it?

1312
01:39:08,040 --> 01:39:10,390
A couple of children against four Hollows.

1313
01:39:10,560 --> 01:39:12,070
Let's get this over with.

1314
01:39:31,720 --> 01:39:32,720
Jake, I'm stuck!

1315
01:39:39,240 --> 01:39:40,240
Hurry up!

1316
01:39:44,200 --> 01:39:45,830
Watch out!

1317
01:40:01,760 --> 01:40:02,820
They're coming!

1318
01:40:17,920 --> 01:40:18,920
Let's go.

1319
01:40:27,120 --> 01:40:28,870
Enoch. Now!

1320
01:40:47,640 --> 01:40:48,640
Go! Now!

1321
01:41:01,800 --> 01:41:02,940
Starting to see them now.

1322
01:41:05,960 --> 01:41:06,960
Phase two.

1323
01:41:12,120 --> 01:41:13,120
Emma, go.

1324
01:41:16,840 --> 01:41:18,790
Don't just stand there. Get them!

1325
01:43:05,600 --> 01:43:08,550
All right. Good job, guys. It's time for step two.

1326
01:43:08,720 --> 01:43:10,110
Save Miss Peregrine!

1327
01:43:10,280 --> 01:43:11,790
That's sort of step three.

1328
01:43:11,920 --> 01:43:13,590
First, we've got to deal with Barron.

1329
01:43:17,960 --> 01:43:19,750
They should've been back by now.

1330
01:43:19,960 --> 01:43:21,310
I said it was a trap.

1331
01:43:21,480 --> 01:43:22,950
If that's true...

1332
01:43:23,920 --> 01:43:26,790
perhaps we should move the Ymbrynes now.

1333
01:43:26,960 --> 01:43:28,310
You're not serious?

1334
01:43:28,480 --> 01:43:30,780
Do I not look serious?

1335
01:43:30,960 --> 01:43:34,310
Do I not look like a man who has searched the globe...

1336
01:43:34,520 --> 01:43:36,980
looking for just one more eye to eat...

1337
01:43:37,640 --> 01:43:39,940
in hopes of regaining sufficient humanity...

1338
01:43:40,120 --> 01:43:42,230
to return to his research?

1339
01:43:42,440 --> 01:43:45,000
A man who's spent years hunting Ymbrynes...

1340
01:43:45,160 --> 01:43:47,990
in preparation for this night...

1341
01:43:48,200 --> 01:43:50,950
and two, no, three days, in Wales...

1342
01:43:51,160 --> 01:43:53,670
pretending to look at birds!

1343
01:43:53,840 --> 01:43:55,190
I assure you...

1344
01:43:55,360 --> 01:43:57,590
I will not stand idly by...

1345
01:43:58,640 --> 01:44:02,150
to see my destiny derailed.

1346
01:44:08,960 --> 01:44:10,150
Hugh, do it now!

1347
01:44:24,680 --> 01:44:25,820
Come back here!

1348
01:44:26,000 --> 01:44:27,000
Get them!

1349
01:44:34,840 --> 01:44:35,840
Go. Get down!

1350
01:44:38,320 --> 01:44:41,670
You think you can stand in my way?

1351
01:44:42,160 --> 01:44:46,030
You, Jake, content to age and die...

1352
01:44:46,200 --> 01:44:49,950
as if you had not the gift of peculiarity at all?

1353
01:44:55,240 --> 01:44:58,550
I am a higher being.

1354
01:44:58,720 --> 01:45:01,870
I hold the secret to eternal life!

1355
01:45:02,040 --> 01:45:03,180
Sorry to interrupt.

1356
01:45:03,720 --> 01:45:05,190
What the...

1357
01:45:16,520 --> 01:45:17,520
Bronwyn.

1358
01:45:23,760 --> 01:45:25,230
You missed me again, Jake.

1359
01:45:25,400 --> 01:45:28,550
I take it accuracy is not your peculiarity.

1360
01:45:39,040 --> 01:45:42,350
Abe was a much worthier adversary.

1361
01:45:45,760 --> 01:45:47,750
Don't let him get to the birds.

1362
01:45:59,560 --> 01:46:02,230
You must put me in contact with your tailor.

1363
01:46:04,280 --> 01:46:07,950
Ymbrynes, Ymbrynes! Here I come!

1364
01:46:20,320 --> 01:46:21,380
Cold?

1365
01:46:21,600 --> 01:46:23,950
Wait till the blood freezes in your veins.

1366
01:46:28,640 --> 01:46:30,680
That was your attempt to rescue your friend, was it?

1367
01:46:54,480 --> 01:46:56,670
Jake.

1368
01:46:56,840 --> 01:46:58,170
I'll hold him off as long as I can.

1369
01:46:58,200 --> 01:46:59,630
When are you going to realize

1370
01:46:59,720 --> 01:47:01,430
you are a terrible shot with that thing.

1371
01:47:03,280 --> 01:47:05,280
Get the others. I'll meet you at the loop entrance.

1372
01:47:18,480 --> 01:47:19,540
Let's get you out.

1373
01:47:48,840 --> 01:47:50,030
Eventually...

1374
01:47:50,200 --> 01:47:52,660
you're going to run out of breath.

1375
01:47:52,840 --> 01:47:56,030
And it'll all be over!

1376
01:47:56,240 --> 01:47:59,830
Death for your beloved Jake and Miss Peregrine...

1377
01:48:00,000 --> 01:48:03,230
everlasting life for me!

1378
01:48:06,080 --> 01:48:08,350
And a mint for you.

1379
01:49:02,280 --> 01:49:04,070
Olive.

1380
01:49:08,640 --> 01:49:10,270
I'm so sorry, Olive.

1381
01:49:12,320 --> 01:49:14,110
All these years, I never appreciated you.

1382
01:49:15,640 --> 01:49:17,430
I didn't see how lucky I was.

1383
01:49:19,760 --> 01:49:23,070
I got so used to having you there, I never realized...

1384
01:49:31,000 --> 01:49:32,000
You never realized what?

1385
01:50:22,040 --> 01:50:24,470
Find your children. Create new loops.

1386
01:50:27,880 --> 01:50:29,230
So, Jake...

1387
01:50:29,400 --> 01:50:32,710
I see you've inherited your grandfather's peculiarity.

1388
01:50:32,880 --> 01:50:35,150
You're just as annoying as he was.

1389
01:50:38,240 --> 01:50:39,870
Speaking of Abe...

1390
01:50:40,360 --> 01:50:42,820
if you should see him in the afterlife...

1391
01:50:43,560 --> 01:50:45,190
give him my regards.

1392
01:50:53,720 --> 01:50:56,070
Please. We can't risk him taking you again.

1393
01:51:15,120 --> 01:51:16,750
Enoch! Where are the others?

1394
01:51:16,920 --> 01:51:18,850
They're safe. Olive is leading them back to the Ghost Train.

1395
01:51:18,880 --> 01:51:20,750
Jake needs us. Barron's too strong.

1396
01:51:28,440 --> 01:51:29,910
You've lost Miss Peregrine.

1397
01:51:30,280 --> 01:51:32,470
You've lost everything. It's over.

1398
01:51:46,000 --> 01:51:47,110
Jake?

1399
01:51:51,400 --> 01:51:52,620
Jake?

1400
01:51:56,480 --> 01:51:57,750
Jake?

1401
01:52:04,440 --> 01:52:05,630
Emma?

1402
01:52:05,800 --> 01:52:07,710
No, wait. Look. That's not me. It's Barron.

1403
01:52:07,800 --> 01:52:08,800
Don't listen to him.

1404
01:52:08,920 --> 01:52:10,060
He's Barron. No, I'm Jake.

1405
01:52:10,200 --> 01:52:11,310
That's Barron.

1406
01:52:11,960 --> 01:52:13,470
I've got a better shot than Jake.

1407
01:52:13,640 --> 01:52:15,320
So, neither of you move until we sort this.

1408
01:52:15,480 --> 01:52:16,830
Listen to me. I'm Jake.

1409
01:52:17,040 --> 01:52:19,750
I grew up in Florida and I wanted to be an explorer.

1410
01:52:19,960 --> 01:52:22,280
I thought nothing would ever change because I was ordinary.

1411
01:52:22,640 --> 01:52:24,190
That's Jake. Get Barron.

1412
01:52:24,360 --> 01:52:25,570
No. Look. I told him all of this.

1413
01:52:25,600 --> 01:52:26,870
She was my psychiatrist.

1414
01:52:27,480 --> 01:52:29,670
Look, you deal with him. I'll go find Miss Peregrine.

1415
01:52:38,160 --> 01:52:39,160
Wait.

1416
01:52:40,320 --> 01:52:42,310
Look, I can prove that I'm me...

1417
01:52:43,200 --> 01:52:45,030
because I'm not ordinary.

1418
01:52:47,560 --> 01:52:49,830
I can do something no one else can

1419
01:52:58,400 --> 01:53:00,670
I can see the monsters.

1420
01:53:08,520 --> 01:53:09,990
No, wait. It's me!

1421
01:53:27,240 --> 01:53:28,270
Enoch!

1422
01:53:44,240 --> 01:53:46,750
We need to go. The loop is closing.

1423
01:53:49,920 --> 01:53:51,110
Those of us who are leaving.

1424
01:54:57,320 --> 01:54:58,320
Emma.

1425
01:54:58,440 --> 01:54:59,630
You love your grandfather.

1426
01:55:00,080 --> 01:55:01,630
There's nothing more to explain.

1427
01:55:02,080 --> 01:55:05,270
No, I promised Miss Peregrine I'd look after you all.

1428
01:55:05,440 --> 01:55:07,590
And with her injured, and you without a loop...

1429
01:55:07,760 --> 01:55:09,030
She'll recover.

1430
01:55:09,840 --> 01:55:12,950
Until then, we'll be in 1943.

1431
01:55:13,440 --> 01:55:15,900
We'll only age one day at a time.

1432
01:55:16,080 --> 01:55:17,300
Like normal people.

1433
01:55:18,120 --> 01:55:19,430
Which can be no bad thing.

1434
01:55:19,640 --> 01:55:21,670
What about the Hollows?

1435
01:55:21,840 --> 01:55:24,270
As long as they're out there, you're not safe.

1436
01:55:25,360 --> 01:55:28,030
We don't need you to make us feel safe, Jake.

1437
01:55:28,720 --> 01:55:31,510
Because you made us feel brave.

1438
01:55:32,000 --> 01:55:33,470
And that's even better.

1439
01:56:36,440 --> 01:56:38,870
Come on, guys. Let's go.

1440
01:57:13,280 --> 01:57:14,500
Tygrysku.

1441
01:57:22,080 --> 01:57:24,510
And then we said goodbye...

1442
01:57:25,200 --> 01:57:27,070
and the loop closed.

1443
01:57:28,360 --> 01:57:31,150
I was so scared that you wouldn't be here.

1444
01:57:32,960 --> 01:57:34,830
That I'd never see you again.

1445
01:57:35,760 --> 01:57:37,310
I'm safe.

1446
01:57:40,640 --> 01:57:43,430
Let me give you your birthday present.

1447
01:57:44,480 --> 01:57:46,400
Grandpa, my birthday isn't for months.

1448
01:57:51,320 --> 01:57:53,310
For your travels.

1449
01:57:54,480 --> 01:57:56,030
Go to her, Jake.

1450
01:57:57,640 --> 01:57:59,310
You have the map.

1451
01:57:59,480 --> 01:58:02,470
You can get back to 1943.

1452
01:58:05,000 --> 01:58:07,630
No. Even so, they took a boat.

1453
01:58:07,800 --> 01:58:09,550
I don't know where they are.

1454
01:58:11,680 --> 01:58:14,140
But you know where they were.

1455
01:58:53,040 --> 01:58:56,870
You have no idea how long it took me to get here.

1456
01:58:59,000 --> 01:59:01,030
The closest loop was in the California desert.

1457
01:59:10,000 --> 01:59:12,270
I used it to get to the Tokyo loop.

1458
01:59:16,560 --> 01:59:19,910
And that led me to the nearest loop back in 1942...

1459
01:59:20,080 --> 01:59:22,190
where I wound up joining the Navy.

1460
01:59:22,360 --> 01:59:23,870
Don't ask.

1461
01:59:24,040 --> 01:59:25,950
Then I spent two months in London trying to...

1462
01:59:53,280 --> 01:59:56,230
Ready for full speed ahead!
